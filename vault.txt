African eggplant may also be referred to as scarlet eggplant, bitter tomato, mock tomato, garden egg or Ethiopian nightshade and is native to Africa, likely resulting from the domestication of a related species, S. anguivi .Crop Details Scientific Name: Solanum aethiopicum Common Name: african scarlet eggplant,bitter tomato (En);Â aubergine amÃ¨re, aubergine africaine, aubergine Ã©carlate, tomate amÃ¨re, djakattou (Fr); é​ ž æ´²ç´…èŒ„ (Cn); nakati etÃ​ope, berenjena escarlata (Sp).African eggplant fruit African eggplant African eggplant flowering African Eggplant Content African eggplant fruit Field of African eggplant African eggplant fruit Uses & Benefits African eggplant is grown primarily for its bitter orange-red fruit, which may be eaten boiled, steamed, pickled or in stews with meat and other vegetables.Young leaves are also often used in soups.African eggplants are a source of fiber, potassium, and offer traces of beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, iron, and calcium.
Varieties of African Eggplant African eggplants, scientifically known as Solanum aethiopicum, vary in color and shape based on the cultivar. The species isÂ divided into four main groups: Gilo, Shum, Kumba, and Aculeatum.Each group has unique characteristics: Gilo : Edible fruits that vary from spherical to oval shapes.Kumba : Has a primary stem with edible leaves and fruits, which can be green or red.Shum : A short plant with small, smooth leaves.Its shoots are edible, but its small fruits are bitter and less preferred.Aculeatum : Recognized for its flat fruits, often grown for ornamental use.Propagation Basic Requirements Growth requirements for African eggplant vary with variety.All types grow best in full sun and well-draining, deep soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8.Gilo types grow best at daytime temperatures between 25 and 35Â°C (77 and 95Â°F).
Kumba types can grow in hotter temperatures of up to 45Â°C in low humidity, whereas Shum types require warm and humid conditions in order to thrive. No varieties of African eggplant tolerate very cold or water-logged conditions.Growing from Seed African eggplant seeds can be collected from fully ripe fruits.Once the seeds have been extracted, they should be laid out on a piece of paper to dry in a place where they are not exposed to direct sunlight.Once dry, seeds can be stored for many years and still remain viable.Seeds should be planted in a prepared nursery bed and should be sown 15 cm (6 in) apart with a further 20 cm (8 in) between rows.Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they reach 15 to 20 cm (6â€“8 in) in height and have 5â€“7 leaves.Plants should be hardened prior to transplanting by gradually reducing the amount of water they receive.Plants should be spaced 50 cm (20 in) apart allowing 75 cm (30 in) between rows.
General Care and Maintenance African eggplants will benefit from frequent irrigation during the dry season, particularly when fruiting, to ensure high yields. The crop should be weeded as required to prevent competition.Addition of fertilizer in the form of cattle or chicken or cattle manure or compost will improve yields.Harvesting African eggplant is typically ready for harvest 100 to 120 days after planting.The fruit should be harvested before the skin changes color from white to pale yellow when the skin becomes tough.Fruits should be harvested regularly to About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms encourage maximum fruit production.Young leaves may be harvested from 45-60 days of growth.

Alfalfa has a deeply penetrating taproot and the stems of the plant branch from a woody base, growing upright and erect or along the ground.The leaves of the plant are made up of three individual leaflets (trifoliate) which are are narrow and oval or oblong in shape with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy lower surface.Alfalfa plants produce flowers on racemes (flower stalks) and each raceme possesses 10â€“35 densely packed purple flowers.Alfalfa produces spirally coiled seed pods each containing 2â€“6 seeds.
Pods may have a smooth or hairy outer surface. Alfalfa plants can reach a height of 120 cm (47 in) and live for between 3 and 8 years.Alfalfa is also commonly referred to as lucerne and is believed to have originated in Caucasus area, north-western Iran and north-eastern Turkey.Crop Details Scientific Name: Medicago sativa Common Name: lucerne, purple medic (En);Â alfalfa, mielga (Sp);Â luzerne (Fr);Â luzerna (Pt);Â à¤… à¤²à¥​à¤«à¤¾à¤²à¥​à¤«à¤¾ (Hi).Alfalfa seed pods Alfalfa beds in field Alfalfa plants in bloom Alfalfa Content Alfalfa flowers Close-up image showing trifoliate alfalfa leaf Healthy alfalfa foliage Alfalfa ready for cutting Uses & Benefits Alfalfa leaves are edible and can be eaten as a leafy vegetable.Alfalfa is used primarily as forage for animals and is cut and stored as hay or silage.As a legume, the plant fixes nitrogen so can be used to increase nitrogen in the soil and is a commonly used cover crop.
Alfafa is a good source of vitamins, calcium, iron, phosphorus andÂ potassium. Besides its use as feed, alfalfa has been traditionally used as a medicinal herb for humans.Its seeds and dried leaves can be consumed as supplements, or sprouted as edible alfalfa sprouts.Varieties of Alfalfa Farmers growing alfalfaÂ should consider the followingÂ factors when selecting varieties to plant: Purpose : Decide why you're growing alfalfa.If it's for making hay, focus on varieties that can withstand time and yield a lot.If it's for grazing, pick types that can grow back quickly after grazing.Dormancy & Winterhardiness : Check the dormancy rating of the variety you want to plant.Ratings range from 1 (very dormant) to 10 (not dormant).In places with warm winters and little frost, go for varieties with ratings of 9 or 10.
Disease and Pest Resistance : Choose varieties that can at least moderately resist common diseases like bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, phytophthora root rot, verticillium wilt, and anthracnose. Forage Yield :Â It's a good idea to see if a variety has performed well in your specific region before deciding to plant it.This helps ensure a good yield.Propagation Basic Requirements Alfalfa is adapted to grow in a wide variety of environments but it requires careful management.Alfalfa grows best in deep, fertile, well-draining soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.Alfalfa has a deep and vigorous root system and quickly depletes nutrients from the soil.If grown in a soil that is poor in nutrients, the crop may require the addition of copious amounts of fertilizer.The vigorous root system means that alfalfa can tolerate dry periods and still give a good yield.Seeding Soil should be well prepared prior to planting alfalfa seeds.
A firm seedbed is recommended to improve the stand by improving seed contact with the soil. This helps seeds to retain moisture and prevents new roots from drying out.The soil can be firmed prior to planting by using a roller.The seedbed should also be free of weeds and kept moist.Alfalfa fields should be sown 5 cm (2 in) deep in rows spaced 45 to 60 cm (18 to 24 in) apart.Seeds should be watered immediately and the bed kept moist while the seedlings emerge.General Care and Maintenance The alfalfa stand should be kept free from weeds.The easiest way to achieve this when the crop is being grown on a commercial scale is with the use of a pre-plant herbicide.There are several of these product available for use on alfalfa.Fertilizer should be applied in accordance with soil test results.Lime, phosphorus and potash are the most important nutrients for a healthy alfalfa stand.Harvest Alfalfa is harvested at different times depending on it's intended use.
Alfalfa which is cut between thee late bud and early bloom stage generally gives acceptable yields of high quality feed without reducing the quality of the stand. In contrast, repeated harvest of alfalfa which is till in the vegetative stage of growth leads to a reduced stand.In the first year, alfalfa can generally be harvested twice without any detrimental effect on winter survival; once in summer prior to the flowers emerging, and once later in the year with the date depending on location.Alfalfa is usually harvested by combine and baled as hay or cut for direct feeding to animals.Alfalfa bales Harvested alfalfa field References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.2014.Medicago sativa datasheet.[Accessed 05 November 14].Paid subscription required Frate, C.A.& Davis, R.M.(2007) Alfalfa diseases and management In C.G.Summers and D.H.Putnam (eds)., Irrigated alfalfa management for Mediterranean and desert zones.Chapter 10.

The tree has brown or gray bark and either an erect or weeping growth habit depending on the variety.The trunk can reach 30 cm (12 in) in diameter.Almond leaves are 7.5â€“13 cm (3â€“5 in) long with a serrated edge and grow alternately on the branches.The tree produces white to pale pink flowers and hairy green fruits which are oblong in shape.The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed.The seed is protected by a hard brown shell.At maturity, the flesh of the fruit becomes leathery and splits to reveal the nut inside.Nuts generally measure 3.5 to 6 cm (1.4â€“2.4 in) in length.
Almond trees can reach heights between 4 and 10 m (13â€“33 ft) and have a commercial lifespan of between 30 and 40 years. Almond may be referred to by variety and this includes bitter almond almond nuts are generally about long and may also be referred to as sweet or bitter almond depending on variety and originates from wild species found in Central and Southwest Asia.Almonds in tree Almonds and blossoms Almonds Flower close-up Almonds in Spring Almond trees in blossom Almond Content Almond blossoms Almonds on a branch Almond flower bud Uses The almond nut is eaten raw or processed into butter, flour, extract, oil, paste, syrup, and milk.Almond oil is used as a flavoring agent in baked goods, perfumery and medicines.Sweet almond oil is used for cosmetic creams and lotions.Propagation Basic requirements Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters.
The optimal temperature for their growth is between 15 and 30Â°C (60â€“85Â°F) and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of between 300 and 600 hours below 7.2Â°C (45Â°F) to break dormancy. Almond trees will grow best when planted in deep, well-draining loam although they can withstand drought and grow in poor soils.The trees benefit from being planted in areas sheltered from frost and wind as trees bloom early and can therefore be susceptible to damage from late frosts.Trees will generally bear nuts after 3 to 4 years with the nut crop developing after blossom, in the fall.Propagation Almond trees are most commonly propagated by budding.Dormant wood is collected in winter when the trees are dormant and stored until Spring.T-budding is usually carried out in Spring and involves joining a bud from one variety to the rootstock of another.The bud is taken from a parent with desirable characteristics and grows to produce a new tree.Trees may also be propagated by grafting.
Cuttings are taken from trees during dormancy and grafted to a suitable rootstock in the Spring. Planting Once trees have been acquired from a nursery, it is important to plant as soon as possible and keep the roots moist in the meantime.Almond trees should be planted by digging a hole just deep enough to accommodate the root ball.The tree should be planted by carefully backfilling the soil into the hole around the tree after it has been properly positioned.Planting depth should not exceed the height of the graft union.The soil around the newly planted tree should then be tamped and watered deeply but not excessively.If planting multiple trees then they should be spaced in rows 6â€“7 m (20â€“23 ft) apart with 5â€“6 m (16â€“23 ft) between each tree.Pruning Almond trees should be pruned in the first year and every subsequent year to help thin the canopy and prevent disease.The first pruning is critical in establishing the canopy shape.
Three limbs should be selected to form the basis of the trees canopy and all others removed, including any growth below the lowest limb. In the second year, two scaffolds (lateral branches which grow to form a Y with the primary limbs) should be selected and the rest removed.Aim for the remaining scaffolds to be evenly spaced around the canopy.General care and maintenance Almond trees will benefit from a layer of mulch around the base to prevent the growth of weeds and conserve soil moisture.Mulch should be spread around the tree in a 1 m (3 ft) radius.Leave a gap between the mulch and the trunk to prevent rotting the trunk.In addition, an application of fertilizer should be made once in Spring before any new growth and again in the Fall.Almond harvesting References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Prunus dulcis datasheet.[Accessed 05 November 14].Paid subscription required Doll, D., DeBuse, C.& Beede, B.(2011).Almond Pruning and Training.

The plantÂ grows best in full sunshine and requires little water for its establishment, growth and reproduction.It prefers areas with mean annual temperatures within the range 19-27Â°C, but can tolerate temperatures ranging from 10Â°C to 35Â°C.
The Aloe vera plant has a short, stout stem and a rosette of fleshy, lanceolate leaves which have a serrated margin of small white teeth. The leaves may be flecked with white and are pale green or grey-green in colour.Aloe vera plants produce a conspicuous inflorescence composed of densely packed pendulous yellow flowers on a spike which can be up to 90 cm (35 in) in height.The plant itself can grow to be 1 m (3 ft) in height, itÂ takes 4-5 years to mature and can live for up to 100 years if well cared for.Aloe vera is indigenous to Eastern and Southern Africa.It belongs to a large class of plants known as â€œxeroidsâ€​ characterised for its ability to close its stomata completely to avoid loss of water.This adaptation allows plants to survive long and extreme drought periods.Crop Details Scientific Name: Aloe veraÂ (L.) Burm.f.Common Name: true aloe (En);Â aloÃ¨s officinal, aloÃ¨s vrai, aloÃ¨s vulgaire (Fr); lu hui (Cn); sabila, sÃ¡vila (Sp).
Aloe Vera Content Aloe plants producing suckers Cut leaves showing Aloe pulp Aloe flowers Aloe vera flower spike Aloe plant from above Aloe vera plant Uses & Benefits Aloe vera plants are grown for medicinal value including improving digestion and boosting the immune system. They are also grown for extraction of the gel inside the leaves.The gel is used in desserts, yoghourts and beverages.The gel is also commonly used as a home remedy for treatment of burns and to prevent constipation.It is also used as a skin and hair nourisher.The plant contains vitamins A (beta-carotene), C and E, which are antioxidants.It also contains vitamin B12 and folic acid.Varieties of Aloe Vera The Aloe genus includes over 500 plant species.Aloe plants are divided into three rough groups: tree aloes, shrub aloes and stem-less aloes.The groups can be differentiated through leaf colour, toothing, shape, as well as plant height and flowering style.
Some species are grown asÂ ornamentals for theirÂ attractive architectural leaves and colourful flowers. Zebra aloeÂ ( Aloe saponaria )Â variety is characterized by its distinctive white stripes or spots on the leaves.Â Arabian aloe ( A.rubroviolacea ) has long blue-green leaves with red teeth and is planted outdoors in warm climates; the leaves turn red if exposed to full sun.Aloe barbadensis miller is known for its thick and fleshy leaves that contain a high concentration of gel and is valued for its medicinal properties.Propagation Basic Requirements AloeÂ vera grows best in full sunshine and requires little water for its establishment, growth and reproduction.It prefers areas with mean annual temperatures within the range 19-27Â°C, but can tolerate temperatures ranging from 10Â°C to 35Â°C.It is adapted to areas with mean annual rainfall in the range 700 mm to 3000 mm.
During the winter months in the subtropics, the plant becomes dormant and utilizes very little moisture.The pH of the soil should range from 6 to 7.5, and it should be fertile and well-drained. Growing from Seed Aloe Vera can be grown from seeds, but is most easily propagated from suckers which are readily produced by the mother plant.The suckers are commonly referred to as â€œpupsâ€​.The pups should be cut from the main root by gently uprooting the mother plant and finding the point of attachment.The young plant should be cut from the parent using a sharp knife.Pups can be safely removed when they have several sets of leaves.The young plants should be planted in their own pot and watered deeply.Refrain from overwatering to force the growth of new roots.If multiple plants are being planted, provide them with individual pots or plant at least 60 cm (24 in) apart outdoors.When planting using seeds, aim at a spacing of 3ft by 3ft.Spacing is extremely important for high quality harvest.
A typical Aloe Vera plant has 25 leaves which extend up to full length of between one foot and 2 feet. This is why experts recommend a minimum spacing of 3 feet all round.Â Planting the seeds in organic matter-rich, well-drained soil is recommended.General Care and Maintenance Aloe plants are generally very easy to care for but care should be taken to avoid overwatering.The plants should be watered deeply but allowed to dry out before the next watering.Check the soil prior to watering.Allow the soil to dry down to a depth of 7.5 to 10 cm (3-4 in) for older, well-established plants or 3.5-5 cm (1-2 in) for younger plants.In addition, although Aloe plants require lots of light, sitting them in full sun can be harmful and it is best to position potted Aloes in a bright window.
If the plant is receiving too much sun, the leaves will begin to turn brown.Â Â Aloe vera can tolerate moderate wind conditions, but excessive wind can damage the leaves and lead to dehydration.Â Â Balanced organic or slow-release fertilizers rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium can be applied during the growing stageÂ to support healthy growth. Harvesting Aloe plants are usually harvested 4 times per year.The crop takes some 18 to 24 months to mature.Ideally, you should take around three leaves per plant.That comes to a total of 12 leaves per plant every year (keep in mind that only older outer leaves are harvested).You can expect an annual harvest of 60,000 kilograms of Aloe Vera per acre per year.References Akinyele, B.O., Odiyi, A.C., (2007).Comparative study of vegetative morphology and the existing taxonomic status of Aloe vera L.Journal of Plant Sciences, 2(5) 558-563.http://www.academicjournals.net/2/archive.php?id=2&theme=2&jid=jps Amura, C.(2020, 30 April).

Amaranths are branching broad-leaved plants with egg-shaped or rhombic leaves which may be smooth or covered in tiny hairs.The leaves have prominent veins, can be green or red in color and have long petioles.The plants produce single flowers on terminal spikes which are typically red to purple in color.Amaranths can reach up to 2.5 m (6.6 ft) in height and are usually grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season.
Amaranth may also be referred to as Chinese spinach and their origin is unclear due to their worldwide distribution. Crop Details Scientific Name: AmaranthusÂ spp.(A.cruentus, A.dubius, A spinosus, A tricolor, A.caudatus) Common Name: pig weed, african spinachÂ (En);Â Ã©pinard piquant, amarante, Ã©pinard malabarÂ (Fr); amarantos, moco de pavo, (Sp); è Ž §è​œ (Cn) Mexican Amaranth - Amaranthus cruentus Amaranthus Red amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus) Amaranth Content Amaranthus caudatus Green Amaranth Amaranthus seed head and seeds Amaranthus hybridus var.paniculatus (L.) Thell.(AMARANTHACEAE) Amaranthus flowering Amaranthus tricolor Uses & Benefits Amaranth leaves and stems are commonly eaten after cooking in a manner similar to spinach.There are four main species which are cultivated as vegetables; A.cruentus, A.blitum, A.dubius, and A.tricolor.Several species, such as A.caudentis, A.cruentis and A.
hypochondriacus are grown as a grain crop in places such as Mexico, Nepal and India and are used to produce cereals and snacks.Â The leaves are cooked alone or combined with other vegetables. The seedsÂ are grounded into flourÂ or cooked into porridge.The leaves are rich in manganese, calcium, iron, vitamins A, B and C while the seeds are rich in beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols.Varieties of Amaranth Of all the indigenous tropical leafy vegetables, amaranth has the largest number of species and varieties.The choice of variety varies widely among regions and is dictated largely by the species available.Regardless of species, the choice of variety is influenced by individual preference for leafÂ colorÂ and taste.To identify which varieties are best adapted to your location, compare during different growing seasons the yield potential of currently grown varieties with that of other available varieties.A.
tricolor : Amaranthus tricolor is a first growing herbaceous plant ofÂ 30â€“125 cm height. This variety comes in various leafÂ colorsÂ such as dark green, red, scarlet, maroon, purple, yellow, and cream.A.blitum : It grows between 10 and 80 cm tall, sometimes reaching 90 cm.The leaves are green or more or less purple in color and matures 4 weeks after sowing.A.dubius : It grows up to 150 cm in height.This variety can be green or tinged purple.The flower clusters are in spikes on side branches andÂ these can be branched.Â HarvestingÂ may be done 3-4 weeks after sowing.A.hybridus : The stems are thick and often ribbed or tinged with red.The leaf and stem surfaces have small fine hairs.Propagation Basic Requirements Amaranth grows from sea level to 2400 m altitude.The different species may suit different altitudes.Normally the hotter it is the better it grows and it generally thrives within a temperature range of 22-30Â°C.
A minimum temperature of 15- 17Â°C is needed for seed germination. Amaranth is grown during both wet and dry seasons, though irrigation is normally required for dry season crops since the rate of transpiration by the leaves is fairly high.Frequent applicationÂ of water isÂ required, related to the stage of growth of the crop and the moisture-retaining capacity of the soil.It can however tolerate periods of drought after the plant has become established.It is adapted to low to medium humidity.Amaranth grows best in loam or silty-loam soils with good water-holding capacity, but it can grow on a wide range of soil types and soil moisture levels.Amaranth can tolerate a soil pH from 4.5 to 8.Growing from Seed Amaranths are propagated from seed and can be planted either byÂ transplanting or direct seeding.Certified seeds with special attributes, such as tolerance/resistance to pest and diseases and high yielding should be used.
Indirect seeding, seeds are either broadcasted or sown in rows at 0.5 to 1.0 g per m2 of bed.Â Since Amaranth seeds are very small, seeds are mixed with sand at a ratio of 1g seed to 100g sand for easy sowing andÂ uniform stand. Farmers can instead choose to mixÂ 1 part of amaranth seeds to 4 parts of chicken manure or ash.Seeds should be sown to a depth of 1â€“2 cm (0.4â€“0.8 in) in rows spaced 50 cm (20 in) apart and covered with a very light layer of soil.Â Â When the seeds germinate allow them to grow for one week.before thinning theÂ plants to keep 20 cm (8 in) spacing from each other.General Care and Maintenance Amaranth is easy to care for and requires little maintenance.While the seedlings are young, it is important to remove any weeds from around the plants to prevent competition.Applying a layer of mulch will help to prevent weeds and conserve soil moisture.
The plants will benefit from supplemental irrigation during dry periods and the addition of fertilizer once or twice throughout the growing season.160 kg/acre of NPK 10â€“10â€“20 is recommended.Â The crop should be top dressed to promote better re-growth with CAN at monthly intervals. 15 days after transplanting, apply N at 20kg/acre as top-dressing.Harvesting Amaranth leaves are harvestedÂ by thinning and clipping.During thinning, the whole plant is uprooted.Thinning starts 2-3 weeks after germination or when the plant has 6-8 fully grown leaves.Leaves can also be clipped at regular intervals.Clipping may startsÂ 3-4 weeks after germination.The tender leaves are clipped once a week until the onset of flowering.Â Frequent harvest prolongs the harvest period and delays onset of flowering.Grain amaranth varieties are usually ready to harvest after about three months.The flowers can simply be cut from the plant using a pair of scissors and set in a warm, dry place to finish drying out.
When the flowers are dry, seeds can be removed by brushing or by beating the flowers in a bag. Passing the beaten flowers through a fine screen mesh can help to remove the seeds from the chaff.Reference Grubben, G.J.H.(2004).Amaranthus tricolor L.Plant Resources of Tropical Africa , 2 , 84-88.Iamonico, D.(2022) â€˜Amaranthus blitum (livid amaranth)â€™, CABI Compendium .CABI.doi: 10.1079/cabicompendium.4648.Laux, M.(2005).Amaranth.Agricutural Marketing Resource Center.[Accessed 05 November 2014, link removed November 1st as no longer live].Free to access.Marcone, Massimo & Kakuda, Yukio & Yada, Rickey.(2003).Amaranth as a rich dietary source of beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols.Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands).58.207-11.10.1023/B:QUAL.0000040334.99070.3e.Seymour, T.(2013).Foraging New England.Falcon Guides.2nd Edition.Morris Book Publihing, LLC.Â [Accessed 05 November 2014, Google Books].

The plant has alternately arranged leaves and a grooved stalk.The petioles on the lower leaves can range in length from 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in), and they are rounded with a serrated edge.As the plant grows taller, the upper leaves get increasingly shorter and feathery.The aniseed plant produces umbels of white flowers as well as an oval, hairy fruit with one seed that is flattened and hairy.An annual plant, anise has a height range of 45 to 60 cm (17.7 to 23.6 in) and only has one growing season.
Anise may also be referred to as aniseed and originates from the Mediterranean Crop Details Scientific name: Pimpinella anisum Anise flowers Anise Anise plant Anise Content Uses & Benefits Aniseed is widely used to flavor pastries; it is the characteristic ingredient of a German bread called anisbrod, Aniseed is also widely used in meat and vegetables throughout the Mediterranean and Asia. It is widely used as an herbal tea and has been used medicinally since ancient times.Absinthe, anisette, and Pernod liqueurs are flavored with the essential oil.The leaves are used as an alcohol flavour in drinks like raki.Salads can also contain leaves Preserving and Storing Anise Drying: Dry anise seeds on trays of paper for several warm days outdoors.After drying, pasteurize the seeds in the oven at 100Â°F for 15 minutes.Storing: Store leaves and seeds in an airtight container.
Propagation Basic prerequisites Temperatures between 6 and 24Â°C (42.8-75.2Â°F) and 12 to 18Â°C (53.6-64.4Â°F) are ideal for anise growth in temperate and subtropical climates. Frost won't be tolerated by the plants.Anise can be grown successfully in a range of soil types, although it thrives best in soils with a pH of 5.0 to 8.0.The plants grow poorly in sandy or heavy clay-based soils and thrive best in well-draining loam.Since they are sensitive to transplanting, seedlings grow best when planted directly outside.The seeds benefit from being soaked overnight before planting to speed up germination, and they should only be sown after all threat of frost has passed.Before planting the seeds, the planting area should be ready by tilling the soil to a fine tilth.If multiple plants are being grown, allow 2.5-15 cm (1.0-6.0 in) between individuals within the row and a further 15-90 cm (6.0-35.4 in) between rows.The seeds should be sown between 1 and 3 cm (0.4-1.2 in) deep.
Keep the seedbed moist as the seeds germinate by not letting the soil entirely dry out. Where to Plant Anise Anise seeds should be planted in a sunny, wind-free location in the garden.Due to its thin stems, this herb may require staking if the wind picks up.Finding the ideal location in your garden for anise may need some trial and error because it is usually very sensitive to the hot sun and chilly northern winds.For a sweet licorice aroma just feet from the kitchen, you may also grow anise in pots right outside your back door.Try planting anise alongside coriander in a colorful collection of pots with other herbs that have similar growing requirements.How and When to Plant Anise The anise plant is sensitive to cold weather.Plant anise outdoors in warm climates with a long growing season after the final spring frost and after the soil has warmed up.
Anise seeds should be sown indoors in biodegradable pots eight weeks prior to transferring the seedlings outside once all threat of frost has gone in colder locations with a shorter growing season. Anise seeds take a while to sprout.In actuality, it could take up to four weeks until the first seedlings poke their heads from the soil.Anise seeds should be sown at a depth of 1/4 inch; germination takes 20 days or so.Plant spacing should be between 6 and 18 inches.Plants should be spaced at least 18 inches apart once they are 6 weeks old.Grow six anise plants for fresh leaves and cooking, and twelve for seeds and preservation.Planting a companion anise Companion planting: Anise is said to promote the growth of cilantro.Aphids and fleas are believed to be repelled by the strong scent of anise.Never grow anise near carrots or radishes.Grow creeping thyme beneath the foot of anise.Light.Full sun is ideal for anise growth.
Aim to place your anise plants where they will receive at least 6 hours of daily direct sunlight. Water and Soil.Plant anise in loamy, well-drained soil.Add several inches of compost to very heavy soil to give plants the light-textured soil they prefer.When the ground starts drying up, water anise, but do not overwater it.Fertilizing.Around your anise plants, spread a layer of compost to help with fertilizer supply during the growing season.Around midsummer, you can also give your plants a dose of all-purpose fertilizer.Harvesting of the seeds.Cut the flower stalks and seed heads, then hang the stalks upside down in a warm, dry, shaded area.Wrap the seed heads in a paper bag so that the seeds will fall into the bag.Thresh the seeds after drying, or pasteurize them for 15 minutes in a 100Â°F oven.Before the first fall frost, finish the harvest.References Penn State Extension (2014).Anise.College of Agricultural Sciences.

Symptoms Small round yellow, brown or black spots on leaves; concentric ringed pattern; holes in leaves where lesion has dropped out Cause Fungi Comments Spread by seed; poor air circulation favors spread Management Treat seeds with hot water prior to planting; prevent disease by keeping plants well watered; if disease emerges remove and destroy plant; remove all plant debris from soil as fungi can survive on pieces of plant Downy mildew Peronospora umbellifarum Plasmopara nivea Symptoms Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; white fluffy growth on underside of leaves; lesions become darker as the mature. Cause Fungus Comments Disease affects young, tender leaves; disease emergence and spread is favored by prolonged leaf wetness.Management Plant pathogen-free seed; do not overcrowd plants; rotate crops with non-umbelliferous varieties.
Powdery mildew Erisyphe heraclei Symptoms Powdery growth on leaves, petioles flowers stalks and bracts; leaves becoming chlorotic; severe infections can cause flowers to become distorted. Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can spread long distances in air; disease emergence is favored by high humidity and moderate temperatures; infection is most severe in shaded areas.Management Plant tolerant varieties; avoid excess fertilization; protective fungicide applications provide adequate protection; sulfur application can be used in infection occurs early in season.Rust Puccinia spp.Uromyces spp.Nyssopsora spp.Symptoms Light green discolored lesions on leaves which become chlorotic; yellow-orange pustules on underside of leaves; stems bend and become swollen or distorted; plants may be stunted.Cause Fungi Comments Some species infect only parsley while others have alternative hosts which may provide a reservoir for the disease; disease emergence is favored by high humidity.
Management Plant in well-draining soils to reduce humidity around plants; apply appropriate systemic fungicide. Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Willow-carrot aphid) Cavariella aegopodii Carrot-willow aphid colony on stem Carrot-willow aphid colony Carrot-willow aphid Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants.Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; willow-carrot aphid will also attack parnip, carrot and celery.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Armyworm Pseudaletia unipuncta Armyworm adult armyworm (Pseudaletia unipuncta) larvae Armyworm Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. Cause Insect Comments The armyworm, Pseudaletia unipuncta , is sometimes called "true armyworm" to distinguish it from other species that include "armyworm" in the common name.In Florida, Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda is often called armyworm, and occurs frequently; in contrast, Pseudaletia unipuncta is not found frequently in Florida.
This insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year. Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae.Cutworms Agrotis spp.Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Greasy cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon aneituma) adult Colorful larva of the variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia).
Cutworm severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed. Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato.
Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically. Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.Galls or nodules associated with the root system caused by root-knot nematodes.Symptoms Galls on roots which can be up to 3.3 cm (1 in) in diameter but are usually smaller; reduction in plant vigor; yellowing plants which wilt in hot weather.

Apple fruits are one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the world.They are round (pome) in shape and range in color from green to red.Apples may also be referred to as "mela" or "appel." The domestic apple tree is believed to have originated from Western Asia and the Mediterranean, having several wild ancestors.China is the largest producer of apples worldwide.
Apple Varieties in Kenya In Kenya, the average production quantity from an apple orchard is 6 to 10 tons of apples per acre. Apple farming is confined to the highland regions of Kiambu, Kitale, and Nandi.The commonly grown apple varieties in Kenya include Winter Banana, Anna, Top Red, Braeburn, Fiji, Golden Dorset, and Cripps Lady.Winter Banana: A delicious apple variety, medium to large in size, with a yellow-green base color and a light to cloudy orange color on top.Anna: A medium-sized apple with a red color or pink blush over a light green to yellow skin.The flesh is creamy white, very sweet, and juicy when fully ripe.Top Red: The fruit is large and recognizable by its cone shape and intense red color.These apples are sweet and very aromatic, with crunchy and juicy flesh.Braeburn: The fruit is not quite round and appears to be half green and half reddish in color.Fuji: A bi-colored apple, typically striped with yellow and pinkish-red.
It is known more for its flavor and firm texture than its slightly lopsided appearance. Golden Dorset: A medium-sized, firm, and sweet fruit with a golden to soft yellow color.Cripps Lady: Also known as Pink Lady Apples, they are named for their reddish-pink blush color.They are very firm and have a tart flavor and effervescent finish.Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management Apple trees grow best in the tropics and at higher latitudes.They require a mild growing season and a cold winter to break their dormancy.In these latitudes, the tree will flower in spring and the fruit will ripen in the fall.In the tropics, the leaves will remain on the tree longer, making it essentially evergreen, and flowering and fruiting will happen sporadically throughout the year unless the tree manages to enforce a uniform cycle across the entire tree by bending shoots to create a wide tree.In Kenya, apples grow at altitudes of 1800m-2800ml, with rainfall requirements of 1000mm-1800mm per year.
Apple trees require fertile, well-drained, and well-aerated loamy-sandy soil, with a slightly acidic to alkaline pH of 5.5-6.5. Apples require a lot of moisture during the flowering and fruiting stage.Therefore, if you are growing apples in hotter regions, you will need to irrigate your trees.However, keep in mind that excess water around the root zone will encourage disease outbreaks and result in low crop yield.The best method of irrigating apples is through drip irrigation.Uses Apples are most commonly eaten fresh but can also be used for baking and cooking.They can be processed into applesauce, cider, vinegar, juice, or butter.Slices can be dried for later consumption.Apples can also be used for the extraction of useful compounds such as fructose and pectin.Apples are rich in fiber, Vitamin C, minerals, and antioxidants.
They provide the following nutrients: Calories: 95 Fiber: 4 grams Carbohydrates: 25 grams Protein: 0.3 grams Sugar: 10.4 grams Fat: 0.2 grams Vitamin C: 14 percent of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) Vitamin K: 5 percent of the RDI Potassium: 6 percent of the RDI Water: 86 percent Planting Procedure When planted from a seed, an apple tree can take six to ten years to mature and produce fruit of its own. Apple trees are small to medium-sized, reaching heights of 5â€“10 m (16.4â€“32.8 ft), with a central trunk that divides into several branches.The leaves of the tree are oval in shape and can reach up to 13 cm (5.1 in) in length and 7 cm (2.8 in) in width.The standard method of propagating apple trees is by budding.When planting an apple nursery or orchard, it is highly advisable to plant seedlings budded from rootstock to prevent an increase in bud dormancy.Budded trees should be pruned in the first year to encourage new shoot growth.
In the tropics, apple trees require careful management to make heavy crop loads sustainable. This includes bending shoots, pruning the tips, and defoliating the trees.Flowers are also removed to promote growth until the first fruit production, generally after 2 years.Apple trees can also be propagated by grafting and mound layering.Grafting involves joining the lower part of one plant (rootstock) with the upper part (scion) of another.Grafting is usually done during the dormant season and must be performed on dormant scion and stock wood.Mound layering is used to propagate apple clonal rootstocks.Soil is mounded around shoots that have been cut back, thereby stimulating roots to grow at the base of the shoots.A year before propagation begins, 8â€“10 mm (0.3â€“0.4 in) diameter stock plants are planted in rows and then cut back to 45â€“60 cm (17.7â€“23.6 in).They are then grown for one year.In the spring, the plants are again cut back, this time to 2.5 cm (1 in) above the ground.
New shoots gradually form, and more soil and bark are added in mounds around the plants. This cycle can continue throughout the growing season.Then the shoots are harvested by cutting close to the bases.The mother stool beds are then left exposed until further growth of the new shoots has occurred, and another cycle of hilling begins.Apple seedlings are planted with a depth of 10-12 inches and spaced 8-10 feet apart in rows.Harvesting An apple is ready for picking when its background skin color turns from green to yellow.The fruit comes off easily when harvested.Harvesting apples at the right time is key, not only to obtain the highest quality fruit but also to maximize the storage life.Maturation time is dependent on weather conditions during the growing season.Early maturing apples are harvested in August-September.There are several reasons why proper picking technique is important.
First, simply pulling apples from the tree with force is likely to bruise the fruit and remove the stems. Apples without stems do not store as well as apples with stems.Second, it is easy to identify apples that have been picked incorrectly.They will have noticeable fingerprint bruises.Make sure to palm instead of grab when picking.Yanking tends to remove spurs from the tree.These fruit spurs represent next year's crop, so by pulling them off, there will be fewer apples to harvest next year.In addition to not pulling the apples from the tree, there are some other actions that are important to avoid.Apples that have touched the ground are a potential source of contamination.Never mix apples from the ground with picked apples.Apples that are decaying or rotten should be dropped on the ground and never placed in your bin.Do not throw or drop apples into your bucket, as this will certainly cause bruising.And always avoid squeezing the fruit when picking.

Management Practice good water management to prevent emergence of disease; do not over-water trees or allow water to accumulate in soil; there is no treatment for Phytophthora infection once present; no apple varieties are resistant to all strains of the pathogen. Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Green apple aphid, Woolly apple aphid) Aphis pomi Eriosoma lanigerum apple aphid (Aphis pomi) overwintering eggs Woolly apple aphid damage Infestation of apple tree with woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) Woolly apple aphid colony apple aphid (Aphis pomi) infestation Woolly apple aphid colony Cankerous tumours on apple shoot caused by colonies of Eriosoma lanigerum.Green apple aphid colony on crab apple Woolly aphid damage Woolly aphid infestation Perennial canker on an apple tree, caused by woolly aphids (Eriosoma lanigerum).
Woolly apple aphid infestation on crab apple Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, woolly apple aphids are covered in masses of white, wool-like material; green apple aphids are dark green when they forst hatch and change to yellow-green with darker green spots as they mature; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants. Cause Insects Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.

Moth pupa in apple fruit Codling Moth Larva in Apple Damage to apple fruit by moth larvae Infected fruits Codling moth larva in apple fruit Symptoms Holes and burrows in fruit; holes may be blocked with crumbly brown frass (insect excrement); wounds may be shallow or may be deep burrows extending to the fruitâ€™s core; adult insect is a dark brown moth; larvae are pink with a brown head and may be up to 1.3 cm (0.5 in) long.Cause Insect Comments Insect usually undergoes 2-4 generations per year.
Management Proper pruning methods help to open out tree canopy to ensure treatments penetrate interior of the tree and reach larvae; removal of any wild hosts or trees in abandoned orchards helps remove reservoirs of insect; organically acceptable control methods include application of Entrust and kaolin clay; small scale growers and home gardeners can remove infested fruit by hand before larvae leaves fruit to reduce insect population; successful reduction of insect population in large scale orchards is usually achieved by mating disruption by releasing pheromones over successive years.
Leafhoppers (White apple leafhopper, Rose leafhopper) Typhlocyba pomaria Edwardsiana rosae White apple leafhopper adult White apple leafhopper nymph on underside of leaf white apple leafhopper Nymphal skin Characteristic white stippling on crab apple leaf caused by leafhoppers Symptoms White stippling on foliage; may be a reduction in fruit size; black specks of frass on fruit; sticky exudate on fruit and leaves caused by excretion of honeydew by insect. Cause Insect Comments Damage resembles that of spider mites but is much more noticeable; insect usually reaches highest number close-to or after harvest.Management Control of leafhoppers is becoming problematic as they are developing resistance to organophosphate insecticides; sprays of appropriate insecticides are most effective at controlling the insect before the adults emerge; monitor trees for appearance of nymphs.
Leafrollers (Omnivorous leafroller, Redbanded leafroller, etc) Platynota stultana Argyrotaenia velutinana omnivorous leafroller (Platynota stultana) larva Redbanded leafroller on apple leaf Symptoms Leaves of plant rolled and tied together with silk webbing; feeding damage to rolled leaves; defoliation of plant; silk webbing may also be present on fruits and fruits may have substantial scarring from feeding damage; larvae wriggle vigorously when disturbed and may drop from plant on a silken thread. Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a moth which can fly over several miles to find suitable hosts.Management Monitor plants regularly for signs of infestation; remove weeds from plant bases as they can act as hosts for leafrollers; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; apply sprays carefully to ensure that treatment reaches inside rolled leaves.
Roundheaded apple tree borer Saperda candida Damaged tree Roundheaded apple tree borer (Saperda candida) adult Adult insect Borer holes at base of tree Larvae Symptoms The presence of bore holes at the base of tree which are covered by pigtail-shaped frass and/or darkened areas in the bark due to sap flow are the proof of insect infestation. The young may kill by one or two larvae infestation.The older trees show drying and break off near the base.Cause Insect Comments The insect is quite common in US and Canada.The host range of this insect is apple, pear, quince, mountain-ash, hawthorn and serviceberry.Management Use of trunk wraps to avoid insect attack.Removing and killing of larvae from the tunnel if possible.Application of suitable insecticide.
Stinkbugs (Various) Various Adult red shouldered stink bug Symptoms Dark colored pinpricks on fruit; depressed dimples on fruit surface with white, pithy area underneath; stink bugs often carry pathogens in their mouthparts which can cause secondary infections and decay of fruit; adult insect is shield- shaped and brown or green in color; may have pink, red or yellow markings; eggs are drum shaped and laid in clusters on the leaves; larvae resemble the adults but are smaller; insect frass may be visible on the fruit is small, brown teardropped shaped deposits Cause Insect Comments Adult insects overwinter under leaves, on legumes, blackberries or on certain weeds such as mustard or Russian thistle Management Remove weeds around crop which may act as overwintering sites for stink bugs and practice good weed management throughout the year; organically accepted control methods include the use of insecticidal soaps, kaolin clay and preservation of natural enemies Category : Mites Spider mites Tetranychus urticae Characteristic stippled leaf caused by spider mites Symptoms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Apricot, Prunus armeniaca is a deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruit.
The apricot tree is has an erect growth habit and a spreading canopy. The leaves of the tree are ovate with a rounded base, pointed tip and serrated margin.The tree produces white to pink flowers, singly or in pairs, and a fleshy yellow to orange fruit.The apricot fruit is a drupe with skin that can be smooth or covered in tiny hairs depending on the variety and a single seed enclosed within a protective outer shell (stone).Apricot trees can reach 8â€“12 m (26â€“39 ft) and can live anywhere between 20 and 40 years depending on variety and growth conditions.Apricots may have as many as three centers of origin in China, Central Asia and the Near East.Apricot blossoms Ripening fruits Green fruit on tre Apricot fruit on tree Uses Apricot Content Apricots can be consumed fresh or dried.They may also be processed into jams and jellies, syrup or juice.Propagation Basic requirements Apricots have a high genetic variability and as a result, they also have a wide range of growing conditions.
The trees tend to bloom early compared with other stone fruits and are therefore susceptible to damage from late frosts. Apricots will grow best in deep, well-draining soils and will not tolerate water saturating.Apricots have a chilling requirement (period of cold required to break dormancy) of between 250 and 1200 hours below 7Â°C (45Â°F) depending on the variety.In addition, most apricot trees do not require a second variety for cross-pollination.Propagation Apricot trees are usually propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent.Trees can be propagated from cuttings or by budding and grafting.Cuttings are lengths of stem usually taken from the previous years growth of an established tree.Cuttings are taken in late winter or early spring and rooted so that they produce a whole new tree.
Budding and grafting involves joining two genetically distinct plants one is used for the lower part called the rootstock and another is used for the upper part, known as the scion. The scion is attached by inserting a bud from the desired variety under the bark of the rootstock so that it produces a new tree.Planting Apricot trees should be planted in full sun.In colder regions it is beneficial to plant them close to a north facing wall which helps reduce the speed with which the trees warm in the spring, delaying bloom.Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole which is slightly wider than the root ball.Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth.It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark.If planting multiple trees, space them at least 7.6 m (25 ft) apart.General care and maintenance Apricots should be pruned annually and are generally trained to an open center.Annual pruning encourages new fruit spurs.
When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to leave 3 or 4 per cluster. This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year.Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development.During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days.Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy.Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Prunus armeniaca datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/44249.[Accessed 05 November 14].Paid subscription required Roper, T., Mahr, D.& McManus, P.(1998).Growing Apricots, Cherries and Peaches in Wisconsin.University of Wisconsin-Extension, Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3639.PDF.[Accessed 05 November 14].Free to access Lamb, R.C.& Stiles, W.C.(1983).Apricots for New York State.

Symptoms If tree is infected after it has reached 5 years of age then typical symptoms include poor terminal growth and small leaves; around midsummer the whole tree suddenly collapses; in orchards trees usually die in a circular pattern; infected trees often have a fan-shaped white fungal mat growing between the bark and wood of the crown. Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives in dead roots; symptoms similar to Phytophthora root rot.Management Once a tree is infected there is no treatment and it should be removed, fumigants do not control fungi in soil adequately; do not plant apricot in newly cleared forest or on the site of old orchards with a history of Armillaria.Brown rot blossom Monolinia spp.
Lesions on apricot fruit due to Monilinia fructicola, M. laxa & M.fructigena.Top left-control; top centre-M.laxa; top right-M.fructigena;bottom left-M.fructigena; bottom centre-M.fructicola; bottom right-M.laxa.Symptoms Death of young blossoms and associated twigs and leaves; small tan cankers with dark margins on twigs; gummy exudate at base of flowers; brown spore masses on flowers in humid conditions.Cause Fungi Comments Fungi survive in mummified fruit and dead twigs.Management 2-3 fungicide applications are required during bloom to control disease; application very important at red bud stage; applications should be made every 14 days or less if there is continued heavy rainfall.
Eutypa dieback Eutypa lata Symptoms Cankers on branches, usually associated with a pruning wound which is several years old; discolored sapwood may extend abovwe and below canker; leaves on branches around canker may suddenly wilt as branch dies; leaves remain attached to branches; discoloured bark and inner wood; gummy amber exudate may be present. Cause Fungus Comments Fungus enters fresh pruning wounds with rainfall 2-6 weeks after pruning; emergence of disease most common in Fall or Winter.Management Infected limbs should be removed 1 ft below any internal symptoms before harvest; if pruning is conducted outwith this time a fungicide should be applied to the pruning wounds.
Jacket rot Botrytis cinerea Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Monilinia laxa Monilinia fructicola Symptoms Brown discoloration of fruit under jacket occurring while flower parts still attached to fruit Cause Fungi Comments Disease emergence favored by wet conditions during bloom and jacket stage Management Fungicide treatment applied at full bloom Powdery midew Sphaerotheca pannosa Podosphaera tridactyla Powdery mildew symptoms on apricot fruit Symptoms Round powdery white patches of fungal growth on fruits and leaves; rusty patches on fruits which turn brown and leathery and may crack Cause Fungi Comments S. pannosa infects plant in Spring.P.
tridactyla infects plant in Summer and Fall Management Apply fungicide during bloom and fruit development Ripe fruit rot Monilinia fructicola Monilinia laxa Symptoms of ripe fruit rot on apricot fruits Symptoms Dark brown circular spots on fruit; tan spore masses may be visible in center of spots; diseases fruit may not drop from tree Cause Fungi Comments Fruit rot symptoms will appear within 48 hours of rain Management A protective fungicide treatment may be necessary if heavy rains are forecast 2-3 weeks prior to harvest Rust Tranzschelia discolor Rust symptoms Symptoms Pale yellow-green spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces which are angular in shape and turn bright yellow in color; spots on lower leaf surface develop orange-red spores. Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in twigs or in leaves which remain attached to the tree.
Management Rust can be prevented by spraying trees with protective fungicides; application is usually carried out one, two and three months before harvest in areas prone to early season outbreaks of the disease and after harvest in areas where disease is less problematic or emerges later in the season. Shot hole disease Wilsonomyces carpophilus Shot hole disease symptoms on a peach fruit caused by Wilsonomyces carpophilus.This disease on peach is distinguished by profuse gumming.Peach fruit displaying symptoms of infection with Shot Hole Disease (Coryneum blight - Wilsonomyces carpophilus).Symptoms Brown lesions with purple edge on fruit, twigs and buds; holes in leaves due to lesions which have dried and dropped out; brown lumps developing in the center of lesion (visible with hand lens); buds turning brown or black and exuding sap; tan lesions with brown margins which exude sap on twigs.Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives in buds and twigs; spores spread by water splash.
Management Application of Bordeaux mixture before rains in Fall are sufficient to protect dormant buds and twigs over winter. Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae Symptoms Withering of leaves on one or more spurs on 1 year old wood; leaves are dull and stunted; fruit small; older cherry trees do not recover from disease Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives in soil or in debris from other susceptible plants Management Plant apricot in soil with no history of disease; keep trees adequately fertilized and watered Category : Bacterial Bacterial canker Pseudomonas syringae Symptoms Cankers on twigs at bases of flower and leaf buds, in pruning wounds or at the base of spurs which exude amber colored gum; cankers spread upwards and form sunken areas in winter; if pathogen enters dormant buds they may be killed or open normally in Spring before collapsing in early Summer; infected buds may be symptomless.
Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors high moisture and low temperatures in the spring; young trees particularly susceptible; trees grown in sandy soils that drain poorly are also susceptible. Management Ensure that a suitable apricot variety and rootstock is chosen based on geographic location and environmental conditions to prevent stress to tree which predisposes tree to canker disease; apply protective copper spray to trees before flowering; prune trees in early summer to decrease likelihood of infection.Crown gall Agrobacterium spp Crown gall Gall symptom Symptoms Galls on root and/or crown of tree which can range in size from so small they are not visible to the naked eye up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter; galls first become visible as white, fleshy swellings that grow rapidly and become tan to brown in color; galls typically develop at the site of a wound and new galls form adjacent to old ones the next year.
Cause Bacterium Comments Infection with crown gall begins at the site of plant wounds; disease emergence is favored by poorly-drained, alkaline soils and previous feeding damage by nematodes. Management Chemical control of the disease is generally ineffective; an effective bacterial biological control is available for commercial production; cultural control methods include: planting only certified, disease-free material, planting apricot in well-draining soil, rotating infected fields with a non-host before apricot is planted and also using good sanitation practices.Category : Oomycete Phytophthora root and crown rot Phytophthora spp.A tree with a Phytophthora crown rot infection caused by Phytophthora spp.in the field.
Symptoms Poor new growth; leaves chlorotic, small in size and sparse; fruit may be small, brightly colored and susceptible to sunburn; shoots may suffer from dieback and tree will often die within weeks or months of first signs of infection or decline gradually over several seasons; root crown may show signs of decay which develops into a canker; bark of infected crown tissue turns dark brown; cankers may occur on aerial parts of plant. Cause Oomycete Comments Severity of disease is linked to soil moisture content; water-saturated soils promote development of fungus.Management Plant trees on a small mound to promote drainage; avoid over-watering trees in spring; treat soil around newly planted trees with fungicide; minimize the frequency and duration of water saturated soil; trees should be propagated from resistant rootstock and application of appropriate systemic fungicides may provide some protection from the disease.

Pests Category : Insects European earwig Forficula auricularia European earwig adult European earwig Adult male and female European earwigs (Forficula auricularia) on a flower. Aggregation of earwigs at tip of plant Symptoms Mature trees generally tolerate damage well; if damage is caused to shoot tips of young trees then growth may be stunted; shallow, irregularly shaped areas may be present on fruit surface where insect has fed; insects are brown and shiny with a pincer-like structure at the end of the abdomen; can reach 1.3 cm (0.5 in) in length.Cause Insect Comments Earwigs are nocturnal and generally undergo two generation per year.Management Remove all weeds from around tree bases; remove all pruning debris and loose bark around trees; wrapping trunks tightly with plastic wrap before nymphs emerge can stop them climbing up the tree; if using insecticide, apply early in Spring when earwigs begin to be active.
Fruittree leafroller Archips argyrospila Adult fruittree leafroller (Archips argyrospila) Adult insect Fruittree leafroller larva Symptoms Leaves of plant rolled and tied together with silk webbing; feeding damage to rolled leaves; defoliation of plant; silk webbing may also be present on fruits and fruits may have substantial scarring from feeding damage; larvae wriggle vigorously when disturbed and may drop from plant on a silken thread. Cause Insect Comments Only one generation of insect per year.Management Monitor plants regularly for signs of infestation; remove weeds from plant bases as they can act as hosts for leafrollers; avoid planting pepper in areas where sugarbeet or alfalfa are grown nearby; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; apply sprays carefully to ensure that treatment reaches inside rolled leaves.
Green fruitworm Various speckled green fruitworm (Orthosia hibisci) ate instar larva Green fruitworm Symptoms Large holes chewed in leaves and fruit; pale green caterpillars with white stripe down middle of back present on leaves and fruit. Cause Insect Comments Insect usually overwinters as adult moth and undergoes only one generation per year.Management If larva become damaging to trees then sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis will control young larvae effectively and can be applied during bloom; other organically acceptable control methods include application of Entrust; appropriate insecticides can be used as spot treatments if infestation is localized or applied shortly before, or during, petal fall.

The buds grow up to 3-4 inches in diameter, have a rounded base, and taper to a tip or block shape.These buds are harvested at an immature stage before they open and reveal the flower.The flower head itself measures 4â€“8 cm (1.6â€“3.1 in) in diameter and consists of numerous triangular scales and purple-colored individual florets.Artichokes take about 150 to 180 days to mature after sowing and can reach heights of 1.4â€“2 m (4.6â€“6.6 ft).Originating from Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, the globe artichoke is known by various names, including leaf artichoke, artichoke, artisjok, artichaut, carciofo, alcachofra, alacachofa, or kharsuf.Italy stands as the largest global producer of artichokes.Artichoke Varieties Green Globe Artichoke: The most common type with wide, deep green buds and a light purple tinge.Excellent for use in salads.
Imperial Star Artichoke: Produces 4-5 inches wide buds with a similar flavor to the green globe variety, albeit slightly sweeter. Violetta Artichoke: Known for its thick purple leaves, this variety offers 5 inches long and 3 inches wide artichokes.It has a nutty, buttery flavor and is commonly used in salads.Big Heart Artichoke: This variety features a large, fleshy base weighing around a pound, and it grows without thorns.The buds are dense and measure 3-5 and a 1/2 inches wide.Baby Anzio Artichoke: The smallest variety, measuring just 2 inches in diameter.It is harvested early, resulting in a tasty bud with a sweet and nutty, caramel-like flavor.Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management Artichokes are cool-season crops and thrive in deep, fertile, and well-drained loam or loamy clay soils with a pH between 6.0 and 8.0.They require high environmental humidity levels and ample sunlight.It is essential to avoid planting artichokes in extreme heavy clay or light sandy soils.
In cases where drainage is an issue, raised bed culture is recommended, as it leads to warmer soil temperatures in spring and faster establishment. The optimal daytime temperature for artichokes is 20â€“22Â°C (68â€“71.6Â°F), with an ideal nighttime temperature of 12â€“14Â°C (53.6â€“57.2Â°F).While these plants can tolerate both cold and high temperatures, extreme conditions can reduce the tenderness of the flower heads.Frost, in particular, can cause blistering in the flower heads and may even kill the buds.Artichokes can grow on slightly sloped fields, but such areas require frequent irrigation to ensure the development of high-quality flower heads.However, waterlogged soil should be avoided, as artichokes cannot tolerate excessive moisture.Throughout the growing season, artichoke plants require frequent watering, which can be done either 1-3 times per week or once every 2-3 weeks.
Adequate water supply during the flowering and bud formation stage is crucial for the formation of a satisfactory number of flower buds, resulting in higher yields. Uses Artichokes are primarily cultivated for consumption and can be enjoyed either raw in salads or cooked.They offer nutritional value, providing a significant source of folic acid, magnesium, iron, and potassium.Additionally, each artichoke contains less than 40 calories, about two grams of protein, and nine grams of carbohydrates.Apart from consumption, artichokes can be canned, pickled, or processed to produce tea, liqueur, or extract secondary metabolites such as cynarin and chlorogenic acid for use in alcoholic beverage preparation.Due to their high antioxidant content, artichokes are considered a health food and have potential benefits in lowering cholesterol and regulating blood sugar levels.
Planting Procedure Artichokes are usually propagated vegetatively from underground shoots known as "ovoli" or from the suckers, stumps, or dried shoots from the previous growing season. Alternatively, they can be grown as annual plants from seeds.For vegetative propagation, existing globe artichoke plants should be divided in Fall or Winter when the plant is dormant.Shoots should be selected from plants that produce well and should be removed when they reach a height of about 20 cm (8 in).To remove the shoots, they should be cut from the mother plant at the root using a sharp knife and gently loosened from the soil and existing root ball.These separated shoots should then be planted in a freshly prepared bed.The roots should be set to a depth of 15 to 20 cm (6-8 in) and spaced 1.2 to 1.8 m (4-6 ft) apart.Closer spacing may lead to fewer secondary buds.During the first year, flower heads should not be harvested to allow the new plants to establish.
For seed propagation, artichoke seeds should be started indoors about two months before the last frost date in the respective area. The seeds should be sown 2.5 cm (1 in) deep in a seed-starting mix within small 4-inch pots.Generous sowing is recommended, as germination success is around 70%, and not all emerging seedlings will produce high-quality plants.Once the seedlings have been hardened and all danger of frost has passed, they can be transplanted outdoors.Plants should be spaced 0.9 m (3 ft) apart in rows that are also spaced 0.9 m (3 ft).After the first year, any plants not producing well should be removed to achieve a final spacing of 1.2 to 1.8 m (4-6 ft) between plants.Nutrient Management During the growing season, globe artichokes benefit from the application of a balanced fertilizer once every month.It is crucial to keep the plants from drying out, so the soil should be kept consistently moist.
Insufficient soil moisture and plant stress during bud formation can result in poorly formed, tough buds of lower quality that do not size well. On the other hand, over-irrigation and long-term soil saturation should be avoided, particularly for heavier soils.To conserve soil moisture, applying a thick mulch is recommended.However, the mulch should be removed when the plants begin to bud, and a generous layer of compost should be used instead.After harvest, the plant stems should be cut back to ground level or slightly below the soil line.For winter protection, the plants' roots should be mulched with plenty of organic mulch, such as about 20cm/8 in of straw and/or leaves.Additionally, covering the plants with a cardboard or styrofoam box filled with straw and leaves can further protect them during winter.Harvesting Globe artichoke flower buds should be harvested before they start to open.Smaller, immature heads are more tender than older buds that are closer to opening.
The buds color and appearance subtly change as they reach the harvest stage. Using a sharp knife, the buds should be cut from the plant, leaving a 2.5 to 7.5 cm (1-3 in) section of stem with each bud.After harvesting all the buds from a plant, the plant should be cut down to the ground.Harvested buds should be inspected for insects, disease, and cosmetic damage.Under proper cold storage conditions, artichokes can store well for three to four weeks.The ideal storage temperature ranges from 32Âº to 34ÂºF, with humidity levels between 90 percent and 95 percent.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2011).Cynara cardunculus var.scolymus datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/17585..[Accessed 05 November 14].Paid subscription required Drost, D.(2010).Artichoke in the garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/HG-2003-03.pdf.[Accessed 05 November 14].Free to access Maynard, A.A.& Hill, D.E.

Category : Fungal Botrytis rot or gray mold Botrytis cinerea Close up of diseased bracts showing sporulation of the pathogen Symptom Gray mold on closely related Cardoon Symptoms Crown of plant slimy and foul smelling; fuzzy white to gray mold present.Cause Fungus Comments More prevalent when rainfall is high.Management Plant in light, well-draining, fertile soils; avoid overcrowding plants and planting seeds too deeply; do not wet foliage when watering, water plants at base; remove crop debris from soil after harvest.Category : Fusarium Wilt Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cynarae Symptoms Wilting, yellowing, and stunted growth.Cause Fungus Comments Management Practise crop rotation, planting disease-resistant varieties, and ensuring proper soil drainage.
Pests Category : Insects Armyworms (Beet armyworm, Yellow striped armyworm) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera ornithogalli Yellowstriped armyworm (Spodoptera ornithogalli) larvae Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) egg mass Yellowstriped armyworm (Spodoptera ornithogalli) adult Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) early stage larvae Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) adult Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year.
Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae. Artichoke aphid Capitophorus elaeagni Lady bug and aphids and ants on artichoke Artichoke aphid colony Symptoms Leaves curling and turning yellow; reduced plant growth; small, deformed buds; stalks cannot support weight of buds and droop; sooty mold growing on plants due to honeydew deposits secreted by insect; insect is small, soft-bodied and pale green to yellowish green in color.Cause Insect Comments Symptoms occur when aphid numbers are large; insects should be visible on underside of leaves; become more problematic in high temperatures and humidity.
Management Destroy plant immediately after harvest to prevent population spread; wash aphids from plants with a strong stream of water; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are effective organically acceptable methods of control. Artichoke plume moth Platyptilia carduidactyla Platyptilia carduidactylus â€“ Artichoke Plume Moth Artichoke plume moth Symptoms Holes in leaves and stems which are discolored black and filled with frass (insect excrement).Cause Insect Comments More of a problem when growing artichoke as a perennial.Management Pick all infested buds at harvest and destroy; cut plant stems above ground, shred plants and incorporate into soil; apply Bacillus thuringiensis or insecticide.
Flea beetle (Palestriped flea beetle) Systena blanda palestriped flea beetle (Systena blanda) adults feeding injury Palestriped flea beetle Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance. Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied.

About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range.
Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully. Category : Mites Spider mites (Two-spotted spider mite) Tetranychus urticae Close-up view of two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) Two spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) twospotted spider mite adult Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant.
Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack. Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction.For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Arugula, Eruca sativa , is a leafy annual vegetable in the family Brassicaceae which is grown as a salad green.The arugula plant possesses a rosette of basal leaves which grow low to the ground.
The leaves of the plant are deeply lobed and dull green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or light yellow flowers which will develop into a seeded fruit.Arugula will reach maturity after 45â€“60 days and can reach a height of 20â€“100 cm (7.9â€“39.4 in).Arugula may also be referred to as rocket, roquette, rucola, or rugula and originates from the Mediterranean regions of Morocco and Portugal.Arugula foliage Arugula seedlings Arugula flowers Uses Arugula leaves are sharp tasting and can be used in salads or as a seasoning.They can also be cooked prior to consumption.Propagation Arugula Content Basic requirements Arugula is best grown in the cooler temperatures of Spring and Fall as summer temperatures trigger flowering and the leaves become excessively bitter.Arugula grows best in full sun in a rich, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 8.0.The plants can tolerate some light shade, particularly in hotter temperatures.
Planting Arugula is commonly direct seeded and can be planted 1 to 2 weeks before the last frost date. Seeds can also be started indoors 4-6 weeks prior to the last frost to get a head start on the growing season.Arugula grows best in cool temperatures but can be damaged by frosts so it is best to provide it with cover if a late frost is forecast.Plant seeds by sprinkling on the ground and lightly covering with soil.Keep the soil moist.The seeds should germinate in 3 to 10 days.Harvesting Arugula is ready to harvest in about 40 days.Harvest leaves from the outside of the plant by pinching them off with your fingers or snipping them with a pair of scissors.The center of the plant should be left undisturbed to promote new growth.References Morales, M.and Janick, J.(2002).Arugula: A promising specialty leaf vegetable.p.418â€“423.In: J.Janick and A.Whipkey (eds.), Trends in new crops and new uses.ASHS Press, Alexandria, VA.

The asparagus plant is tall with scale like leaves emerging from the underground stem (rhizome) and has stout stems and feathery foliage.The flowers are bell shaped and occur alone or in pairs.They are green-white to yellow in color.After flowering, a round red berry is formed with 1 to 6 black seeds.Asparagus can live for 20 or more years and can attain a height between 100â€“150 cm (39.4â€“59.1 in).Asparagus originates from Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.Asparagus harvest Asparagus fruits Emerging asparagus shoots Field grown asparagus Asparagus foliage Asparagus Uses Asparagus spears can be eaten raw or cooked.
They are low in calories and very low in sodium. Asparagus is a particularly good source of vitamin B6, calcium, magnesium , zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, rutin, niacin, folic acid, iron, phosphorus, potassium, copper, manganese, selenium, chromium, dietary fiber, Asparagus Content and protein.Propagation Basic requirements Asparagus grows best in regions with hot days and cool nights and requires 90â€“150 days of cold temperature to break dormancy.It will grow in most soils as long as they are well-draining and will grow optimally at a pH between 6.5 and 7.0.Asparagus should be planted in a sunny location in the home garden and it is best to avoid low lying areas as a late frost will cause damage to newly emerged spears.Growing from seed Growing asparagus from seed is more time consuming and labor intensive than growing from divided crowns.
If growing from seed, be aware that you will be unable to harvest the spears for longer than if grown from crowns (spears can generally be harvested in the third year after planting). Asparagus seeds should be sown indoors 12 to 14 weeks before planting outside.This should be timed so that the outdoor planting date is after all danger of frost for your area.Seeds should be sown in mix, planting 0.6 cm (0.25 in) deep.The seeds should be kept moist, but not wet and will germinate in approximately 3 weeks.Seedlings should be fully hardened off prior to planting outdoors, using a cold frame where possible.Transplanting The asparagus nursery bed should be prepared in advance by digging deeply to break up the soil and incorporating plenty of organic matter such as well-rotted manure and by blending a complete fertilizer into the soil just prior to transplanting.Plant the seedlings 25 to 38 cm (10-25 in) apart in a trench approximately 10 cm (4 in) deep.
The trench should be gradually filled in as the seedlings grow. Keep the soil moist by providing about 2.5 cm (1 in) of water weekly.Once the plants are established, irrigation is generally only required in very dry areas due to the deep root system that the plant produces.It is important to control weeds as not only will it prevent any competition with the asparagus plant but it will also ensure that the young spears can be seen and harvested at the correct time.The asparagus plants should be transplanted to their final planting site in the second year following the directions for planting crowns (below).Planting crowns When purchasing asparagus crowns, choose disease-free, 1 year old crowns from a reputable grower.All-male hybrids tend to be produce more spears than females and are a good choice for growing at home.Crowns should be planted once the soil has warmed to 10Â°C (50Â°F).
Dig a trench 12 to 15 cm (5-6 in) deep and add super phosphate fertilizer to provide the crowns with nutrients immediately after planting. Position the crowns in the trench 30 to 45 cm (12-17 in) apart.It does not matter how the crown are oriented in the trench as they will grow regardless.Backfill the trench to the original level.If planting more than one row, allow at least 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows.New spears should begin to emerge from the soil within a week of planting.Avoid harvesting the spears until the following year.Allowing the ferns to develop and provide energy for the crown to produce spears the following year.Harvesting spears Allow asparagus ferns to remain until the Spring before cutting or mowing them back to the ground to allow new spears to grow.The new spears are ready to harvest when they reach 17 to 22 cm (7-9 in) in length.The spears can simply be snapped by hand close to the ground.
The spears can be harvested every 2 to 4 days for a period of 4 to 6 weeks in the second year (third year if grown from seed). Avoid over-harvesting as this will decrease the yield the following year.The harvest can be extended in the third year (fourth for seed grown plants) to 6-8 weeks.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Asparagus officinalis datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/7408.[Accessed 06 November 14].Paid subscription required .Drost, D.(2003.Asparagus in the Garden.Utah State University Extension.Available at: http://extension.usu.edu/files/factsheets/asparagus.pdf.[Accessed 06 November 14].Free to access .Tong, C.(2009).Growing asparagus in Minnesota home gardens.University of Minnesota Extension.Available at: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/growing-asparagus-in-minnesota-home-gardens/.[Accessed 06 November 14].Free to access .Sams, D.W.Vegetables: Growing Asparagus in Home Gardens.

The avocado tree is large and dome shaped with oval or elliptical leaves arranged in a spiral on the tips of branches. The leaves have a red pigmentation when they first emerge and turn green as they mature.Avocado trees produce clusters of small, green-yellow flowers at the end of twigs and a large, fleshy, pear-shaped fruit with a single large seed.The fruits can be purple to green in color with smooth or warty skin depending on variety.The flesh of the fruit is yellow-green in color and has the consistency of butter.Each fruit contains one large seed.Avocado trees grown from seed can take 4â€“6 years to produce fruit whereas grafted plants may produce fruit within 1â€“2 years.The tree can reach a height of 20 m (65.6 ft) and originated in the rainforests of Central America.
Avocado Content Harvested avocados Fruit developing Fruit on the tree Avocado seed Close up of avocado flowers Avocado blossoming Avocado foliage Avocado fruits Avocado tree Uses The avocado is usually consumed fresh as a fruit or as an ingredient in salads or savory dishes. It has a markedly higher fat content than other fruits and is a staple in diets that have limited access to foods with high contents of monounsaturated fats.It is the main ingredient in guacamole, a popular Mexican dip.In Asia, avocados are used in desserts and dessert drinks.Avocado nutrition Avocados have a lot of calories.The recommended serving size is smaller than youâ€™d expect: 1/3 of a medium avocado (50 grams or 1.7 ounces).One ounce has 50 calories.Avocados are high in fat.But it's monounsaturated fat, which is a "good" fat that helps lower bad cholesterol, as long as you eat them in moderation.Avocados offer nearly 20 vitamins and minerals.
So in a 100-gram serving, you get: 485 milligrams of potassium 81 micrograms of folate 0.257 milligrams of vitamin B6 10 milligrams of vitamin C 2.07 milligrams of vitamin E Avocado growing in Kenya The main varieties of avocado grown in Kenya include; Hass, Fuerte and Puebla avocados. Fuerte is grown largely for local/ domestic consumption while Hass avocado is mainly grown for export and takes about 5 years to bear fruits.Avocado season in Kenya is between March and September, depending on the varieties grown.The main areas where avocados are grown in Kenya are the central highlands of Kenya mainly Thika, Muranga, Nyeri, Embu and Meru areas.However, there are other avocado growing zones outside Central Kenya.These include Eldoret, Kisii, Subukia, Nakuru and Naivasha.Avocado growing in Tanzania The popular avocado varieties produced in Tanzania are Hass, Fuerte, Pinkerton, and, to some extent, Puebla.
Tanzaniaâ€™s prominent avocado-producing areas are in the regions of Mbeya, Njombe, Songwe, and Iringa in the southwest, as well as in Kilimanjaro, Arusha, and Tanga in the northeast of the country, where coffee and tea are traditionally grown. Avocado in Uganda Uganda is a tropical country located in East Africa.They have perfect conditions for avocados and have well-established varieties growing in the country since the 1550s.Uganda has high-quality soil, a warm climate, and ideal rainfall patterns for growing avocados.In fact, Uganda has the most consistent rainfall pattern in the world.Â Hass Avocado are a bit controversial in the Ugandan agricultural sector.Avocado is mainly grown in the western region of Uganda which is known for its fertile soil and favorable climate, which are ideal for avocado cultivation.The districts of Mbarara, Isingiro, and Bushenyi are among the main avocado-producing areas in the region.
Avocado variety The main varieties include: Fuerte The main variety grown in Kenya Hybrid of Guatemalan and Mexican races with thin skinned green-pebbled fruit of very good flavour. This variety has many lines with different shapes; the pear shaped fruit is preferred in the export market.Matures 6-8 months after flowering.Haas Vigorous grower and bears medium-sized, rounded, rough-skinned, black fruits.Propagates well.Matures 8-9 months after flowering.Nabal Bears fruit in alternate years.Its green fruits have a good flavour.Matures 8-9 months after flowering.Puebla Spreading, dark green tree bearing deep purple to maroon round fruit.This variety is normally used as a rootstock.Matures 5-7 months after blossoming.Others include 'Reed', 'Simmonds', 'Booth 7&8', 'Pinkerton', 'Bacon', 'Lula' and 'Taylor' References Avocados | Infonet Biovision Home.

Tanzania Avocado Production and Exports - TanzaniaInvest Propagation Basic requirements Avocados thrive in subtropical or tropical climates but can also be grown successfully in cooler areas of the world.The optimum temperature for growing avocado is between 25 and 33Â°C (77â€“91.4Â°F) with moderate humidity levels.Once established, trees can tolerate temperatures down to around -2Â°C (28Â°F) with minimal damage but young trees will not tolerate freezing temperatures.
Avocado requires a well draining, aerated soil and they produce a shallow root system which require a warm soil for efficient water and nutrient uptake. Although trees will tolerate low rainfall, irrigation, particularly during flowering and fruit set, will ensure high fruit yields.Propagation Avocados are commonly propagated from seeds but the seeds will not breed true to type and this should be taken into consideration before planting.Clonal plants are obtained from budding and grafting from a parent tree to ensure the offspring are of the same high quality of the parent.In plantations, seeds can be sown directly in the soil.2 to 3 seeds are usually sown and thinned later to leave the strongest seedling for grafting.Seeds may also be sown in containers and grown for 2 to 3 months before planting at the final site.Planting Avocado seedling should ideally be planted in the Spring when the soil has warmed through.
Choose a location that receives full sun and has protection from the wind. The trees should be planted by digging a hole a little wider than the root ball and gently easing the tree into the hole.Slow release fertilizer can be added to the hole at planting but is not necessary.Care should be taken not to disturb the roots as much as possible and the hole should be carefully backfilled and the soil and tamped to prevent dislodging.Trees should be planted 4.5 to 6 m (15â€“20 ft) apart in rows spaced 6 m (20 ft) apart.General care and maintenance Newly planted young trees should be mulched after planting with several inches of straw or woodchips.Young trees will also benefit from staking which will help to prevent wind damage.Wood stakes should be driven into the ground outside the root ball allowing 2 stakes per tree.The tree should then be tied loosely to the stakes to provide support while it establishes.
Young trees should be irrigated and the root ball should not be allowed to dry out. Trees should be watered every few days.Water trees at and around the base to ensure the root ball is wetted.Trees are usually fertilized at around 4 weeks after planting.Add half a cup of urea every 4 to 6 weeks during the growing season.Manuring One avocado tree can yield 250-300 kg of fruit per harvest season.This causes a high demand on soil nutrients.To determine the right amount of manure to apply the soil should be tested annually.Pruning Initial pruning may be done to give the tree a good shape.Otherwise pruning is limited to the removal of dead wood and parasitic plants.Remove all sucker and dead branches from main trunk branches.Prune canopy to keep the tree to a height of 5-8 m and for ease of picking.The tree is very susceptible to sunburn, therefore pruning should be minimised.Prune the larger tree roots by cultivating to a depth of 50 cm around the edge of the tree canopy.
The area around the tree should be kept clean by weeding and removal of all fallen fruits. Harvesting Harvesting starts at 3-4 years from planting but a good yield is obtained from the 6th year onwards.It is not easy to tell when the fruits are ready for harvesting unless they are of the varieties that change colour at maturity.Harvest a sample and keep at room temperature.If they soften within 7-10 days without shrivelling then the fruit of that age are ready for harvesting.

Common Name mosquito fern Azolla Content Azolla pinnata Feathered mosquito-fern (Azolla pinnata) Azolla filiculoides Azolla (macro) Azolla fronds Azolla Description Azolla is a genus of seven species of aquatic ferns in the family Salviniaceae. They resemble duckweed or other mosses more than other conventional ferns because of how reduced and specialized they are.Only two fern species have published reference genomes, and Azolla filiculoides is one of them.Azolla pinnata, an aquatic fern from the Azollacea plant family, is largely used as cattle fodder.With a main stem and pinnate side branches, azolla is a tiny branching plant.The side branches are longer at the base of the stem than at the top giving the fronds a roughly triangular shape.Each frond is composed of many overlapping rounded leaves which are covered in tiny hairs on their upper surface.Fronds are bright green in color, but they can take on a reddish tint when they are exposed to direct sunshine.
On the water's surface, floated fronds resemble red velvet. Individual fronds can grow to a length of 1.5 to 2.5 cm (0.6-1.0 in).Azolla is a plant whose native habitat stretches from Africa through India, Southeast Asia, and Australia.Other names for azolla include red azolla, feathery mosquito fern, water velvet, and African azolla.Uses The Azolla plant is commonly grown as a fodder plant for animals and as a companion plant for rice since it fixes nitrogen and suppresses weeds.Propagation Basic prerequisites Azolla must be grown in freshwater or moist mud in order to flourish since if allowed to dry out, the plants will die within a few hours.Azolla plants spread quickly and can be grown in ponds or specially constructed pits.Strong water currents could damage the plant's fronds if it is cultivated in water, hence there should be little to no current.The ideal conditions for azolla growth are in standing water that is 4 to 7 pH and between 5 and 12 cm (2.0â€“4.7 in) depth.
The soil at the bottom of the pond or pool shouldn't be accessible to the plant's roots because this can result in nutrient deficits. Plants will grow optimally at temperatures between 20 and 28Â°C (68-82.4Â°F) in partial shade or full sunlight.Heavily shaded areas should be avoided.Propagation Azolla is first cultivated by seeding a prepared pit or pond.The azolla will rapidly colonize the water and start reproducing on its own.To enable the plant to recolonize, some of the harvest ought to be set aside.To keep the pond from being too congested, plant materials should be collected on a daily basis.Growing azolla Habitat A.pinnata is a floating aquatic fern that can be found at low to moderate altitudes on the surface of tiny, quiet ponds or backwaters without waves.It can entirely cover the water surface in ponds in cattle paddocks and other bodies of water with high nutrient levels, where it becomes exceptionally profuse.
It can survive on damp soil near rivers, ditches, and ponds, which can help the plant withstand dry conditions and low water levels. Lowland populations in New Guinea are found between 3 and 60 meters above sea level and highland inhabitants are found between 1000 and 3000 meters above sea level.Plants from the highlands and those from the lowlands, however, are not readily distinguishable from one another.Biology and Ecology The genetically known number of chromosomes in the genus Azolla is n=22, with various variants.This most likely means that the original count, which came from n=11, was a tetraploid n=22.There have been reports of n=22 in tropical Africa, n=33 in Asia, and n=44 in Australia for A.pinnata.Tropical and subtropical regions experience year-round physiology and phenology growth.Although there isn't a clear connection between sporulation and color change, crowding frequently causes spore reproduction as well as a change to red hue.
Fronds can double in size every three days when they divide vegetatively, which causes them to expand incredibly quickly and colonize new lakes and ponds. phosphorous shortage aids in the development of A.pinnata's red coloring.The upper leaf surfaces are completely water- repellent, and if the plant is completely buried, it swiftly floats back up on its right side.Deoxyanthocyanins are found in A.pinnata and prevent molluscs from eating on it.Biology of Reproduction by fragmenting the fronds, vegetative reproduction is accomplished.Spores are produced during sexual reproduction and dispersed into the water.The heterosporous nature of azolla is an obvious adaption to an aquatic environment.Typically paired micro- and megasporocarps are borne in the axils of submerged lobes, basally on the branches, and are completely surrounded by a thin indusium.Sporangia are produced in sporocarps.
A few of to many globose microsporangia, each bearing 32â€“64 microspores, are present in the big, globose microsporocarp. A single megasporangium with a single megaspore is present in the smaller megasporocarp.Spores might be smooth, trilobate, globose, pitted, or sculptured.In the microsporangium, microspores are embedded in the outer border of a number of mucilaginous masses (massulae), each of which has several to numerous hooked (glochidiate) or unhooked, septate or non- septate processes on some or all of its sides.Megaspore apical massulae, on occasion known as "floats," can be three or nine.criteria for the environment Although Azolla grows more quickly under eutrophic environments, nitrogen levels are not particularly significant for their development.It is particularly prevalent in (wet) rice fields in the nations of Southeast Asia.Utilizing the symbiotic blue-green algae's capacity for nitrogen fixation, it serves as a natural fertilizer.
The cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae has a symbiotic relationship with other members of the genus. Algae inhabits the intercellular spaces of Azolla's basal leaves as an endophyte.Heterocysts in the algal cell fix atmospheric nitrogen, which is then transported as ammonia to Azolla.Control and Prevention The national list of registered pesticides or the appropriate authority should be consulted to ascertain whether products are legally permissible for use in your country when contemplating chemical control due to the varying laws surrounding (de)registration of pesticides.Use of pesticides must always be legal and in accordance with the directions on the label.Chemical Control Applications of terbutryn, glyphosate, and diquat can kill A.pinnata.Kerosene and a wetting agent mixed together can be used for controlling A.pinnata.Thick mats on reservoirs and slow-moving waterbodies have an adverse economic impact on water users.
Agriculture, recreation, and municipal usage of water are some of those that are most severely impacted. Impact to the Environment.A.filiculoides grows rapidly in eutrophic water systems, easily outcompeting native plants.An anaerobic environment is produced below an A.filiculoides mat by decaying root and leaf debris and the absence of light.In addition to very little have the ability to survive in such conditions, poor odors, color, and turbidity lower the quality of drinking water.Cases of livestock and game producers losing animals as a consequence of them refusing to drink from contaminated waterbodies or drowning as a result of mistaking the mat for solid ground have been reported.According to reports, the weed also encourages the growth of diseases that are waterborne, water-based, and water-related, as well as increases water loss through evapotranspiration.Impact on Biodiversity Waterbodies up to 10 hectares in size may develop dense mats (5â€“20 cm thick) due to A.
filiculoides infestations. It has been established that these infestations have a profound negative influence on the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems and have significant ramifications for all facets of water use.The eastern Cape rocky in South Africa, one of the last surviving habitats for the threatened fish species, had become so overrun with the weed that S.bainsii faced extinction if the biological control program had not been so successful.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Azollo pinnata datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/8120.[Accessed 06 November 14].Â Paid subscription required.Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services.(2010).Azollo as Livestock Feed.Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, Cuttack, India.Available at: http://orissaahvs.com/File/FeedFodderDevelopment/Azolla.pdf.[Accessed 06 November 14].Â Free to access.Ferentinos, L., Smith, J., Valenzuela, H.(2002).Azolla.

Bananas are long, curved fruits with smooth, yellow, and sometimes slightly green skin. The average length of a banana is about 7 to 9 inches, and it is about 2 to 3 inches in diameter.The skin of the banana is usually yellow when it is ripe, but it can also be green, red, or purple depending on the variety.The inside of a banana is composed of several fleshy, cream-colored segments, which are surrounded by thin, white membranes.The segments are held together by a central core, and they contain small, black seeds that are not usually eaten.The flesh of the banana is soft, slightly sweet, and has a slightly sticky texture.Bananas are typically planted in the rainy or monsoon season when the soil is moist and can provide enough water to the young plants.In tropical and subtropical climates, where bananas are widely grown, the planting season typically occurs between April and June.In regions with a dry season, the planting may occur in September or October, after the rainy season.
It is important to note that the specific planting time may vary depending on the local climate and growing conditions. Additionally, some commercial banana farms may plant bananas year-round in controlled greenhouse or field environments.The crop is propagated through vegetative reproduction, meaning new plants are produced from existing plant material rather than from seeds.The most common method of propagation is through the use of "suckers" or "pups," which are shoots that grow from the base of the mother plant.The suckers are carefully removed from the mother plant and planted in a new location, where they will develop into a separate plant.In commercial banana farming, the suckers are often treated with rooting hormones to encourage faster and more vigorous growth.Another method of propagation is through the use of "rhizome" or "corm" cuttings, which are pieces of the underground stem of the banana plant that can be used to start a new plant.
This method is less common but may be used in some cases, particularly for rare or specialty varieties of bananas. Bananas are one of the most popular and widely grown fruits in the world, with their largest production occurring in countries near the equator.They thrive in tropical and subtropical climates and are commonly grown in India, China, the Philippines, Ecuador, Brazil, Uganda, Colombia, Indonesia, Cameroon, and Honduras.However, this is not an exhaustive list, as bananas are also grown in other tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.The specific areas where bananas are grown can vary based on local growing conditions, including temperature, rainfall, soil type, and market demand.

Some of the most common and widely grown varieties include: Cavendish : This is the most common variety of banana found in grocery stores and is known for its sweet flavor and yellow skin.Plantain : Plantains are a type of banana that is larger and less sweet than Cavendish bananas.They are typically used for cooking and are a staple food in many countries in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.Red Banana : This variety of banana is smaller and sweeter than the Cavendish and has a red or pink skin when ripe.Lady Finger Banana : This variety of banana is smaller and sweeter than the Cavendish and is a popular snack in many countries.
Blue Java Banana : This variety of banana is also known as the "Ice Cream Banana" due to its creamy texture and sweet flavor. It has a blue-green skin when ripe.Musa Basjoo : This is a hardy banana variety that is native to Southeast Asia and can grow in cold climates.It has a green skin and a sweet, slightly tart flavor.Uganda is one of the largest producers of bananas in the world and grows a variety of different types.Some of the most common banana varieties grown in Uganda include: East African Highland Banana (EABH) : This is the most widely grown cooking variety in Uganda and is a staple food in many households.It has a dense and starchy flesh.Examples include "NAROBAN5", "Kyibuzi" and "Mbwazilume".Ngeyi : This variety of banana is smaller and sweeter than the East African Highland Banana and is commonly eaten when ripe.Examples include "Sukali Ndizi" and "Bogoya".Cavendish : This variety of banana is similar to the one found in grocery stores and is also grown in Uganda.
It is best eaten when roasted on fire. An example is "Gonja".Plantain : Plantains are a type of banana that are larger and less sweet than the Cavendish and are used for cooking.It is a brewery variety that is mainly planted to extract juice and fermented to make beer.It grows under vast environmental conditions.Examples include "Kayinja", "Kisubi", "Mbiide" and "Musa".Brewery variety : This is mainly planted to extract juice, which is then fermented to make beer.They grow under vast environmental conditions.Examples include "Kayinja", "Kisubi", "Mbiide" and "Musa." Other local varieties : In addition to these more widely grown varieties, there are many other local varieties of bananas grown in Uganda, each with its own unique flavor and texture.
Uses Bananas are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin B6, and potassium, and are often used as a healthy snack or ingredient in smoothies and other foods.The fruit is the most widely used part of the plant and can be eaten fresh or cooked or processed into starch, chips, puree, beer, vinegar or dehydrated to produce dried fruit. The fruit may also be processed into flour which is used in baking, soups or beverages.The flowers of the plant may be used as a vegetable.Fresh leaves have a high protein content and can be fed to cattle.Other uses for leaves include polishing floors, lining pots or wrapping food.Climatic conditions, soils and water Bananas are a tropical crop that grows best in warm, humid conditions with high rainfall.Here are the key climatic conditions, soils, and water management considerations for growing the crop.Climatic conditions Bananas are a tropical crop that grow best in warm, humid conditions with abundant rainfall.
The ideal temperature range for growing bananas is between 20Â°C and 30Â°C, with a preferred temperature range of 25Â°C to 28Â°C. High humidity levels are also important for supporting healthy growth and fruit production.Bananas require a minimum of 1000mm of rainfall or irrigation per year to support growth and fruit production.However, it is important to note that the specific climatic requirements may vary depending on the variety of banana being grown and local growing conditions.It is essential to work with local agriculture experts to ensure that the right climatic conditions are in place for successful banana cultivation.Soils Bananas grow best in well-drained, fertile soils with a high organic matter content.They require good aeration and a pH of 5.5 to 7.0.They are also sensitive to soil-borne diseases and to combat this problem, old suckers can also be replaced by young ones.
Water Bananas require regular watering, especially during the dry season, to support growth and fruit production. Over- watering or waterlogging can lead to root rot, so it is important to ensure good drainage and to avoid standing water around the plants.Drip irrigation systems are commonly used for banana cultivation to conserve water and reduce the risk of disease.Pruning a banana plant Pruning a banana plant Planting Procedure Planting bananas may vary depending on the variety being grown and local growing conditions.It is important to work with local agriculture experts or PlantVillage Dream Team officers to ensure the best planting and growing practices for your specific situation.Here is the common procedure: Preparation: Start by selecting a suitable site for growing bananas, taking into consideration factors such as soil type, drainage, and climatic conditions.Test the soil pH and fertility and amend as necessary.
Propagation: Bananas are usually propagated by planting shoots or suckers that have sprouted from the parent plant. Cut a sucker from the parent plant and remove all but the top 2-3 leaves.Planting: Dig a hole in the soil 45x45x45 cm in size and 3m x 3m apart [promise O2] that is large enough to accommodate the roots of the sucker.When digging, place the top black soil on the upper side of the hole and brown or subsoil on the lower side.Place the sucker in the hole, making sure the top of the roots is level with the soil surface, leaving a dome-shaped valley on the surface.[promise O3] Backfill the soil around the roots and water thoroughly.Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the plant to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.Irrigation: Bananas require regular watering, especially during dry periods.Make sure the soil is consistently moist, but not waterlogged.Fertilization: Bananas need regular fertilization to support healthy growth and fruit production.
Apply a balanced fertilizer, such as 10-10-10, at the recommended rate, according to soil test results. Pruning: Prune off the older, lower leaves of the plant as they yellow to keep the plant healthy and improve air circulation.Harvesting Banana harvesting is the process of collecting ripe or near-ripe bananas from the plant.The timing of the harvest is crucial, as it will determine the quality of the fruit and its intended use.To harvest bananas, one must first identify when the fruit is mature, which can be determined by observing signs such as yellowing of the fruit and leaves.Once the bananas are ready to be harvested, a sharp, clean knife should be used to cut the stem of the banana bunch from the plant.It's important to handle the bananas carefully to avoid bruising, and to gently place them in a container or on a flat surface for transport.
If the bananas are harvested when they are still green, they will need to be ripened before eating by placing them in a warm, well-ventilated area until they are yellow and soft to the touch. Ripe bananas can be stored at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator to slow down the ripening process.The exact procedures for harvesting bananas may vary depending on the variety of banana being grown and local growing conditions.It's recommended to work with local agriculture experts, such as those from the PlantVillage Dream Team, to ensure the best harvesting and handling practices for your specific situation.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Musa datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/35124 .[Accessed 0 7 February 23 ].Crane, J.H., Balerdi, C.F.& Maguire, I.(2008).Banana Growing in the Florida Home Landscape.University of Florida IFAS Extension.Available at: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG04000.pdf.[Accessed 0 7 Februay 23 ].

It's an important cereal crop that belongs to the Poaceae family and is widely cultivated for its various uses in human consumption and industry.
Barley, Hordeum vulgare, is an edible annual grass in the family Poaceae grown as a cereal grain crop. It is a tall grass with a hairy stem that stands erect and produces spikelets at the head.The nodes and internodes make up the stem.The internodes are hollow, as opposed to the solid internodes.The inflorescence, or spike, where the grain is generated, is supported by the stalk.The heads of the barley seeds are triangular spikes made up of rachis and three spikelets apiece.20â€“60 grains are produced by each spike.Barley plants freely tiller and usually have one to six stems.Seed heads are not produced by the tillers.An annual crop, barley may grow to a height of 80 to 100 cm (31.5â€“39.4 in) and is harvested every year.Barley was initially domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East and is sometimes referred to as spring barley or winter barley.Varieties There are several varieties of barley, each with its own characteristics and uses.
Some common barley varieties include: Ã˜ Two-row barley (Hordeum vulgare var. distichum) Ã˜ Six-row barley (Hordeum vulgare var.hexastichum) Ã˜ Hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare var.nudum) Ã˜ Malting barley (varieties selected for beer production) Ã˜ Feed barley (used for animal feed) These varieties differ in terms of grain size, shape, color, and suitability for different purposes.Barley is mostly farmed in Kenya's upland portions of the Rift Valley, especially in locations with milder climates and conducive soils.Kenyan farmers frequently cultivate the following types of barley: Barley Varieties: Varieties like "Baraka" and "Tudor" are commonly grown for malting and brewing purposes.These varieties have been developed to meet the requirements of the local climate and brewing industry.Growing Regions: Barley is often cultivated in regions such as Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Nandi, and parts of the Aberdare Range due to their favorable climate and altitude.
It's important to note that agricultural practices and crop choices may vary over time, and it's always a good idea to consult with local agricultural authorities or experts for the most up-to-date information on barley cultivation in specific regions of Kenya. Uses Barley is cultivated as a food cereal in the tropics and subtropics in India, Nepal, Tibet, Afghanistan, Russia, Ethiopia, North Africa, and the Andean region of South America.The straw produced is used as animal feed, bedding, and to cover the roofs of houses.In temperate regions, barley is used in malt production to brew beer and make other distilled alcoholic beverages, particularly whisky.Climatic conditions, soils, and water management Climatic Conditions Barley is a cool-season crop and thrives in temperate climates.It prefers moderate temperatures during its growth stages.During its growth phases, it prefers warmer temperatures.
During the growth season, the ideal temperature ranges for barley cultivation are between 15 and 20 Â°C (59 and 68 Â°F). Frost may be tolerated by barley to some extent, but excessive cold or heat could damage the plant's development.Soils Barley can be grown in a range of soil types, but it prefers well-drained soils with good water-holding capacity.Loamy soils with good organic matter content are generally ideal for barley cultivation.Heavy clay soils can hinder root growth and drainage, while sandy soils may require more frequent irrigation.Water Management Proper water management is crucial for barley farming: Irrigation Barley requires adequate moisture, especially during its early growth stages.Proper irrigation is important to ensure uniform germination and establishment.However, overwatering should be avoided to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root diseases.Rainfed vs.
Irrigated: Depending on the local climate and rainfall patterns, barley can be grown as rainfed or irrigated crop. In areas with reliable rainfall, rainfed barley can be successful.In drier regions, irrigation is necessary to supplement water needs.Timing Water stress during critical growth stages, such as flowering and grain filling, can significantly reduce yield.Proper irrigation timing is essential to support these stages.Mulching Mulching can help conserve soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and suppress weed growth.This can be particularly beneficial in areas with limited water availability.Water Quality The quality of irrigation water is important.Salinity and alkalinity can negatively impact barley growth.Proper water testing and management can help mitigate these issues.Propagation Planting procedure of barley Here's a general planting procedure for barley: Site Selection Choose a well-drained field with good sunlight exposure.
Barley prefers cooler temperatures, so select a location that provides moderate to cool climatic conditions. Soil Preparation Prepare the soil by plowing or tilling to a depth of 6-8 inches.Remove weeds, rocks, and debris from the field.Incorporate organic matter or compost to improve soil structure and fertility.Seed Selection Choose high-quality barley seeds from reputable sources.Select a suitable barley variety based on your region's climate and intended use (e.g., malting, feed, or forage).Seedbed Preparation Create a smooth and level seedbed to ensure uniform germination and emergence.You can use harrows or other suitable equipment to achieve this.Sowing Barley can be sown either by broadcasting or drilling.Drilling is preferred for precise seed placement and even spacing.The recommended seeding rate varies depending on the variety, but a typical range is around 90â€“120 kg/ha (80â€“110 lbs/acre).Depth and Spacing Plant barley seeds at a depth of about 1-2 inches (2.5â€“5 cm).
Row spacing can vary, but a common recommendation is around 6â€“8 inches (15â€“20 cm) between rows. Fertilization Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test results and local recommendations.Barley has specific nutrient requirements, especially for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.Irrigation Provide sufficient moisture for germination and establishment.Depending on local conditions, you may need to irrigate after sowing.Avoid waterlogging.Weed Control Monitor the field for weeds and control them using appropriate methods.Early weed management is crucial to prevent competition with young barley plants.Disease and Pest Management Implement integrated pest management practices to control pests and diseases.Common barley pests include aphids, cutworms, and rust diseases.Growth and Development As the barley plants grow, monitor their health and growth.Adequate water and nutrient management are important during the vegetative and reproductive stages.
Harvesting Barley is ready to harvest when the stalks and heads have turned from green to yellow and the seed heads are drooping towards the ground. Check the seeds for ripeness before harvest.They should be firm and crunchy and not doughy in texture.Commercially produced wheat is usually harvested using a combine.Smaller plots can be harvested by hand using a scythe or sickle.Small plots can be harvested by snipping off the heads with a pair of scissors.Please note that specific procedures may vary based on your location, local conditions, and the type of barley you're planting.It's always a good idea to consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for guidance tailored to your region.Barley being harvested by combine References Anderson, P.M., Oelke, E.A.& Simmons, S.R.(2013).Growth and development guide for spring barley.University of Minnesota Extension.Available at: http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/small-grains/growth-and- development/spring-barley/.

Basil plants are often grown as annuals but may survive for several seasons with some care and can reach heights between 30 and 130 cm (11.8 and 51.2 in) depending on the variety. Basil may also be referred to as sweet basil, St.Joseph's wort, thai basil, lemon basil or holy basil depending on the variety and is native to India and other tropical regions of Asia.Basil plant flowering Close-up of basil flowers Different basil varieties Basil leaves Basil Uses Basil is commonly used as a fresh or dried herb in cooking and is popularly used in beverages in Southeast Asia.Basil Content Essential oil can be extracted from the leaves and used in cosmetics, dental products and perfume.Propagation Basic requirements Basil is a warm season crop which will grow optimally in areas where daytime temperatures are consistently above 21Â°C (70Â°F) and nighttime temperatures stay above 10Â°C (50Â°F).Basil is very sensitive to frost and will need protected if a late cold snap is forecast.
The plant will grow best in a fertile, moist soil with a pH between 6 and 7. Basil requires around 6â€“8 hours of sun every day and benefits from some shade in the afternoon.Sowing seeds Basil seeds should be sown indoors 6â€“8 weeks before planting outside.Sow seeds in a sterile seed starting mix in seed trays or pots 0.2â€“1.0 cm (0.08â€“0.4 in) deep and water gently.Ensure the temperature remains between 15.5 and 27Â°C (60â€“80Â°F).Seeds should germinate in about 5 days at 21Â°C (70Â°F).Transplanting Basil seedlings can be transplanted to the garden when they are between 6 and 8 weeks old, about 2 weeks after the last frost date.Plants should be spaced approximately 30 cm (12 in) apart, allowing 45 cm (18 in) between rows.Pinching back the growing tip of the plants after transplanting will encourage the growth of new shoots.Harvesting Basil leaves can begin to be harvested any time after the plants have reached a height of 15â€“20 cm (6â€“8 in).
Harvest leaves by pinching the leaves from the tips of the stems to encourage the more branching. Leaves should be pinched regularly to keep the plants productive and prevent them from going to seed.Young basil plants Basil seedlings References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Ocimum basilicum datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/36858.[Accessed 06 November 14].Paid subscription required .Meyers, M.(2003).Basil: An Herb Society of America Guide.The Herb Society of America, Ohio, USA.Available at: http://www.herbsociety.org/factsheets/Basil%20Guide.pdf.[Accessed 06 November 14].Free to access .MacKenzie, J.(Ed) (2007).Growing basil.University of Minnesota Extension.Available at: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard- garden/vegetables/growing-basil/index.html.[Accessed 06 November 14].Free to access .Tran, T.(2011).Basil Diseases.Cornell University Department of Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology.

Management Plant seeds in sterile soil; plant basil in well-draining soils. Category : Other Slugs & snails (Gray garden slug, Spotted garden slug, Brown garden snail, European garden snail , etc.) Decoratus reticulatum Limax maximus Helix aspersa Cornu aspersum dusky slug (Arion subfuscus) Cartusian snail (Monacha cartusiana) feeding on leaves amber snails adult European brown snail Banded wood snail Gray garden slug Symptoms Irregularly shaped holes in leaves and stems; flowers and fruit may also be damaged if present; if infestation is severe, leaves may be shredded; slime trails present on rocks, walkways, soil and plant foliage; several slug and snail species are common garden pests; slugs are dark gray to black in color and can range in size from 2.5 to 10 cm (1-4 in); garden snails are generally smaller and possess a rounded or spiral shell.
Cause Mollusc Comments Slugs and snails prefer moist, shaded habitats and will shelter in weeds or organic trash; adults may deposit eggs in the soil throughout the season; damage to plants can be extensive. Management Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs and snails; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g.Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers.
Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Various spp.) Various Aphid on basil Praying Mantis feeding on basil aphid Winged adult aphid Aphid feeding on basil Aphid Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants. Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use. Cutworms, loopers, owlet moths, and underwings Spodoptera exigua Trichoplusia ni and others Larave on basil leaf Loopers Cutworm damage Larva Larvae feeding on basil leaf Larave Symptoms The early stage larvae feeds on terminal clusters.
Later stage larvae skeletonize the leaves. Also, they will cut the seedling stem near the base resulting in heavy loss.Cause Insect Comments The insect has a wide host range.Management Hand pick the larvae and kill them.Remove and destroy weeds and crop residue.Spray biocontrol agent (bacteria/virus) to kill insects.If infestation is severe, spray suitable insecticide.Flea beetle Phylotreta spp.Flea beetle on basil Flea beetle and damage on basil leaf Adult flea beetle on a leaf.Flea beetle damage to leaves Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance.
Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied. Grasshoppers Various sp.Grasshopper feeding on basil leaf Grasshopper feeding on soybean leaves Grasshopper on basil Initial stage grasshopper nymphs damage Symptoms Both adult and nymphs feed on foliage, buds, and tender stems.
The first stage nymphs feed on leaves by forming circular holes. As the insect develops it feeds on entire foliage.Grasshoppers are very eager feeders.Cause Insect Comments It feeds on several crops including weeds.Management Encourage birds in the field.If population is severe, spray suitable insecticide.Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Japanese beetle adult Adult Japanese beetle Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) larvae Adult Japanese beetle on basil leaf Symptoms Leaves skeletonized (only veins remaining); flowers and buds damaged; plant damage may be extensive; adult insect is a metallic green-bronze beetle with tufts of white hair protruding from under wing covers on each side of the body; adult beetles are approximately 13 mm in length; larvae are cream-white grubs which develop in the soil.
Cause Insect Comments One beetle generation every 1-2 years; pheromone traps may actually attract more beetles to home gardens and should generally be avoided; beetle overwinters as larvae in soil; beetle has an extensive range of over 300 host plants. Management If beetles were a problem in the previous year, use floating row covers to protect plants or spray kaolin clay; adult beetles can be hand picked from plants and destroyed by placing in soapy water; parasitic nematodes can be applied to soil to reduce the number of overwintering grubs; insecticidal soaps or neem oil can help reduce beetle populations.Leafminers Liriomyza spp.
Leafminer larave Larvae still with in leaf mine Leafminer fly Leafminer damage Leafminer pupae Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larave hatch and feed on leaf interior. Cause Insects Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year.Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies.Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.

These include bush beans, common beans, dry beans, dwarf beans, field beans, French beans, garden beans, green beans, haricot beans, kidney beans, pole beans, snap beans or string beans. However, presently, two distinct bean types are recognised in the region: French beans (green beans) and common beans (dry beans).French beans are the immature green pods of P.vulgaris and are primarily grown for export market to European Union and elite local urban markets.Common beans are the second most important staple food to maize for the local people.Beans were introduced to Africa from Latin America several centuries ago.To date beans are a vital staple in Africa, providing the main source of protein.Common beans are mainly grown by women for subsistence and for the local market.French beans (green/snap beans) are grown as a cash crop by large scale and smallholder farmers.They are a major export vegetable commodity in Eastern Africa.
Bean Content Bush bean in flower Purple snap bean variety Runner bean flowers Pole bean plant with pods Green bean flowers and pods Green beans Bean Varieties 1.Black Beans Black beans are a staple in many Mexican and Brazilian dishes. They have a velvety-smooth texture and mild flavor.They also have a lower glycemic index than many other high-carb foods, helping to reduce the spike in blood sugar that occurs after eating a meal.2.Black-Eyed Peas This Southern staple has a beige hue with an eye-catching black spot, hence the name "black-eyed peas." They have an earthy flavor that complements salty foods like ham and bacon .3.Cannellini Beans Also known as white Italian kidney beans, these cream-colored beans are one of the most common types of beans.They are a popular addition to soups, salads, and many Italian dishes.4.Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans ) They have a round shape and a firm texture, making them a great salad topping.5.
Great Northern Beans This is another type of white bean that is often mistaken for cannellini or navy beans 6. Kidney Beans These beans are known for their vibrant red skin and white interior.They have a mild flavor, and make the perfect addition to any chili recipe.7.Lima Beans These beans get a bad rap, but there's actually so much to love when it comes to lima beans.They can be white, creamy, or green in color.8.Pinto Beans Pinto beans have an orange-pink color with rust-colored specks 9.Fava Beans Fava beans, or broad beans, can be difficult to work with.They require that you remove them from their pods and then blanch them in order to get the skins off.10.Navy Beans This bean goes by many names: haricot, pearl haricot beans, white pea bean, and Boston bean.They have a mild flavor and creamy texture, and similar to Great Northern Beans, they do a great job of absorbing the flavors around them.
11 Adzuki Beans These small, round red beans , Like other legumes, they're protein-packed and high in fiber. 12.Edamame Edamame are young soybeans which are usually eaten while still inside the pod.13 .Cranberry Beans Rounding out the list are these striking cream-colored beans with red speckles.Also known as borlotti beans, cranberry beans have a creamy texture and a nutty flavor.14.Soybeans Soybeans are dried and beige in color.15 .Mung Beans These beans are one of the most consumed types in the world.They are small, round, and green with a white stripe going through them.They have a mild flavor and a starchy textur e climatic conditions and soil type Common beans grow within a range of temperatures of 17.5-27Â°C.Above 30Â°C flower buds are likely to fall and seeds are rarely formed at temperatures over 35Â°C.They are sensitive to night frost.
Common beans are usually grown at altitudes between 600 - 1950 m in many tropical areas.Â A moderate well-distributed rainfall is required (300-400 mm per crop cycle) but dry weather during harvest is essential. Drought or waterlogging are harmful.ClimbingÂ cultivarsÂ will give economic yields in areas of high rainfall but the dwarf types appear to be more sensitive to high soil moisture levels.Suitable soil types range from light to moderately heavy and to peaty soils with near-neutral pH and good drainage.Common bean is susceptible to salinity.The optimum temperature range for growing French beans is 20-25Â°C, but can be grown in temperatures ranging between 14 and 32Â°C.Extreme temperatures result in poor flower development and poor pod set.However, French beans mature faster in warmer areas.
French beans can be grown between 1000 and 2100 metres above sea level.Â Rainfed cultivation is possible in areas with well distributed, medium to high annual rainfall (900-1200 mm) but to maintain a continuous production especially during the dry season, irrigation is essential. During the dry season up to 50 mm of water per week is required.This could be applied through furrow or overhead irrigation.French beans grow best on well drained, silty loams to heavy clay soils high inÂ organicÂ matter with pH 5.5-6.5.Uses The common bean is used as a pulse and green vegetable eaten fresh or cooked.The beans can be dried, cooked in sauce and canned .The common bean is used as a pulse and green vegetable eaten fresh or cooked.The beans can be dried, cooked in sauce and canned .Nutrition Value Beans are among some of the oldest cultivated vegetables.There are various types of beans that differ with shapes, sizes, taste and nutritional facts.
Kidney beans, pinto beans, broad beans, fava beans, lima beans, etc. are some of the different types of beans.Each of them is loaded with dietary fibers, proteins and major vitamins and minerals like vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, calcium and magnesium.The amount of the above given nutrients varies from one type of bean to other.Beans are very low in fat and cholesterol and they also help to lower the bad cholesterol in the body.Since they are high in proteins, they make an excellent meat substitute for vegetarians.They are extremely low in calories and hence are a favorite food among the calorie conscious people.Before knowing more about beans nutritional value, let us take a look at some figures related to nutrition in beans.Countries where beans is grown The main producing countries in the region are Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda , and more recently Rwanda .In Kenya, most of the crop is grown by smallholders and virtually all is exported to Europe.
Estimates indicate that up to 50,000 smallholder families are involved in French bean production in Kenya. The growth habit of common beans varies from determinate dwarf or bush types to indeterminate climbing or poleÂ cultivars.Bush beans are the most predominant types grown in Africa.However, improved climbing beans introduced to Rwanda in the 80's have since spread to other countries in the region.They are particularly grown in areas with limited land and high human population.Propagation Basic requirements Common beans are warm-season crops and should be planted after all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed.Beans will grow best at soil temperatures between 15.5 and 29Â°C (60â€“85Â°F) and are sensitive to cold temperatures and frosts.Beans will grow best in a fertile, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.75 Beans will perform best in full sunlight.
Sowing seeds Beans should be direct seeded in the garden in when the soil has reached a temperature of at least 15.5Â°C (60Â°F), with the optimum temperature for germination being between 15.5 and 29Â°C (60â€“85Â°F). Planting at cooler temperatures leads to slow germination and promotes seed rotting.Seeds should be planted 2.5â€“3.5 cm (1â€“1.5 in) deep.Bush beans should be planted 5â€“10 cm (2â€“4 in) apart allowing 0.6â€“0.9 m ( 2â€“3 ft) between rows.Pole beans can be planted in both row and hills.In rows, seeds should be spaced 15â€“25 cm (6â€“10 in) apart allowing 0.9â€“1.2 m (3â€“4 ft) between rows.For a continuous harvest of beans over the summer months, make new plantings every 2â€“3 weeks.Poles and trellises Pole beans should be provided with a pole or trellis to climb on to support the weight of the pods and allow light to penetrate to all parts of the plant, helping to prevent disease.
Bean poles should have a rough surface to help the plant to grip and should be 1.8â€“2.1 m (6â€“7 ft) long. Three or four poles can be used to form a tripod onto which the plants can be trained.Bean trellises can be constructed easily using posts (or a tripod arrangement of poles), wire and twine.Position a post at either end of the area in which you wish to plant a row of beans and connect with two lengths of wire.The first wire should be approximately 13 cm (5 in) from the ground, and the second 1.5â€“1.8 m (5â€“6 ft) from the ground.Finally, use the twine to create a V-shaped trellis by tying the twine to the bottom wire, bringing it up to the top wire and looping it back down around the bottom wire.Continue to zigzag the string all the way along the wires to the second support before tying the twine off.A rough textured twine is best as it will encourage the plant to climb and twine around it.
Pinch back the growing tips of the plants once they reach the top support to encourage the plant to branch. Mulching Mulching with straw and cut grasses helps conserve moisture, promote adventitious root development and enhances tolerance to bean fly maggot damage.Intercropping Beans are excellent forÂ intercroppingÂ with other food crops, such as maize, potatoes, celery, cucumber and can help supply the other crops with nitrogen to a limited degree.Longer season varieties of beans can fix higher amounts of nitrogen than short season varieties.Â IntercroppingÂ with chives or garlic helps repel aphids (KIOF - personal communication).Water management A regular water supply is essential for French beans as moisture affects yields, uniformity and quality.Water stress during flowering reduces yields, as does waterlogging.Irrigation in dry spells is recommended as 35 mm per week at planting and 10 days post emergence, followed by 50 mm per week thereafter till end of production.
Harvesting Beans are generally ready for harvest approximately two weeks after bloom. The beans should be harvested just before the seeds are mature and before they form bumps on the pod.The pods should be firm and snap when they are bent.Pick beans every 2â€“3 days to ensure the plants remain productive.Pinch beans rather than pulling to avoid damaging the plant.Cut pole beans from the plant using scissors.Pole beans planted beneath a trellis Bean tripod and trellis References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Phaseolus vulgaris datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/40626.[Accessed 06 November 14].Paid subscription required .Drost, D.(2010).Beans in the Garden .Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HG_Garden_2005-08.pdf.[Accessed 06 November 14].Free to access .Lerner, B.R.(2001).Growing Beans in the Home Vegetable Garden.Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service.

Symptoms Mottled dark and light green patterns on leaves; leaves may be distorted; yellow dots may be present on leaves; growth of plant may be reduced.Cause Viruses Comments BCMV can be transmitted by seed and has a worldwide distribution; BCMNV also transmitted through infected seed but geographic range more restricted.Management Plant only virus-free seed; plant resistant varieties.Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Cowpea aphid, Pea aphid, etc.) Aphis craccivora Acyrthosiphon pisum Black Bean Aphid Aphis fabae The aphids are tended by ants Winged aphids, the vectors of Bean Common Mosaic Virus (BCMV), on a bean leaflet.
Close-up of Black Bean Aphids (Aphis fabae) colony Aphids on lower surface of leaves Aphid infestation on bean plant Cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora) infestation Ladybird beetle feeding on bean black aphids Pea aphid Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants. Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use. Armyworms (Beet armyworm, Western striped armyworm) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera praefica Adult of beet armyworm Beet armyworm egg mass hatching Damage due to early stage beet army worm larvae Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) egg mass covered with hairs.
Beet armyworm adult Beet armyworm eggs Larvae of beet armyworm Beet army worm late instar larvae Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) on leaf Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year.
Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae. Corn earworm Helicoverpa zea Larvae feeding on leaf Damages leaf Larvae Corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) adults Adult and larvae Corn earworm on bean Symptoms Larvae damage leaves, buds, flowers, pods and beans; young caterpillars are cream-white in color with a black head and black hairs; older larvae may be yellow-green to almost black in color with fine white lines along their body and black spots at the base of hairs; eggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are initially creamy white but develop a brown-red ring after 24 hours and darken prior to hatching.
Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a pale green to tan, medium sized moth; insect is also very damaging pests of corn; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil. Management Monitor plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations.Cutworms Agrotis spp.Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Bean leaf skeletonizer (Autoplusia egena) larva Cutworm damage to bean seedling Cutworm larva severing plant stem French beans attacked by Helicoverpa armigera.Note the larvae within the bean.
Cutworm feeding on plant stem Eggs of western bean cutworm (Striacosta albicosta) Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed. Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato.
Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically.

Leafminer larvae Larvae of leafminer vegetable leafminer (Liriomyza sativae) on bean leaves Tunnels caused by leafminer vegetable leafminer (Liriomyza sativae) adult leafminer fly (Liriomyza sp.) pupa Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larvae hatch and feed on leaf interior. Cause Insects Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year.Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies.
Loopers (Cabbage looper, Alfalfa looper) Trichoplusia ni Autographa californica soybean looper (Thysanoplusia orichalcea) on dry beans Looper on bean leaf Cabbage looper Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color. Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range.
Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully.
Mexican bean beetle Epilachna varivestis Adult Mexican bean beetle Mexican bean beetle damage to bean foliage Adult beetle and damage to bean foliage Eggs laid on underside of bean leaf Mexican bean beetle larva Bean plant infested with Mexican bean beetle larvae Symptoms Irregular patches of feeding damage on underside of leaves which causes the top surface of the leaf to dry out, giving the leaves a lacy appearance; insect will also damage flowers and small pods; pods may be damaged so badly that they drop from the plant; adult insect is an orange-brown beetle with black spots; larvae are fat-bodied grubs which taper at the end and are in rows of conspicuous spines Cause Insect Comments Beetles can decimate bean crops; beetles overwinter as adults and undergo 2-3 generations per year Management Some bean varieties may be less attractive hosts for the beetle, e.g.

The plant is usually erect with a long main root and a rosette of leaves growing on stems.The leaves are oval in shape, arranged alternately on the stem and grow 20â€“40 cm (7.9â€“15.7 in) in length.The roots Beet Content are usually red in color.
It produces sessile green flowers that are surrounded by leaf-like bracts and grow on a 4ft tall spike-like structure. The plant produces sessile green flowers and can reach 1â€“2 m (3.3â€“6.6 ft) in height.Beets are usually grown as annual plants, harvested after one growing season.Beets originated from the Mediterranean with Russia being the largest producer of sugar beets.They may also be referred to as beetroot, garden beet or spinach beet.Climate conditions, soil and water management Beets are cool season vegetables with a long growing season.They grow best in cool climates but can tolerate some heat as well as some freezing.Temperature The optimum temperature for their growth is between 15.5 and 18.3Â°C (60â€“65Â°F).Soil Beets grow best in a loose, well drained soil with a pH between 6.2 and 6.8 and should be planted in full sun for optimum development.They have a long taproot, therefore they like well drained loam soil that contain an abundant amount of organic matter.
Watering Even watering will promote the development of good quality roots and prevent the formation of rings in the root. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.Beets prefer even moisture to prevent cracking and toughening of the roots.Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry spells.Aim for at least 1 inch of water per week, either from rainfall or irrigation.Beet Varieties Red Beet: This is the most common and widely recognized beet variety.It has a deep red-purple flesh and skin.It contains an earthy and sweet flavor.Red beets are typically used in salads, pickling, and roasting.Golden Beet: They have a vibrant yellow or golden flesh and a milder, sweeter flavor compared to red beets.They can be used in the same ways as red beets and are often preferred for their more delicate flavor.Chioggia Beet: Also known as candy cane or candy stripe beets have pink and white rings on the inside creating a striking appearance.
They have a mild, sweet flavor and are often used in salads to add a pop of color. Cylindra Beet: Cylindra beets are elongated and cylindrical in shape, making them easy to slice and use in dishes like beet chips or for pickling.Contains a sweet and tender flavor.Detroit Dark Red Beet: This heirloom variety is known for its deep, dark red color and sweet flavor.It's excellent for both fresh eating and canning.Bull's Blood Beet: Bull's Blood beets have dark maroon leaves and deep red roots.They are often grown for their edible greens and are used in salads or as a colorful garnish.They have an earthy and slightly sweet taste.White Beet: White beets have white flesh and a mild, slightly sweet flavor.They are less common than red or golden beets but can be used in various recipes.Baby Beets: These are simply young beets harvested at an early stage when they are small and tender.They can be red, golden, or any other variety, and are often used in salads or as a side dish.
Forono Beet: These beets are short and cylindrical, making them easy to slice into uniform rounds for cooking or pickling. Contains a sweet and tender taste.Uses The roots are consumed after boiling and may be pickled in vinegar.The leaves of the spinach beet plant are consumed as a herb in Indonesia and Japan.Chemicals in the roots can be extracted and used as food coloring.Beets contain a significant amount of vitamins A and C, calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, protein and carbohydrates.Beets are also high in folate, dietary fiber and antioxidants.They are high in betaine which is prescribed to lower toxic levels of homocysteine (Hcy) (which contributes to the development of heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease).The highest levels of vitamins and other nutrients are available when the vegetables are eaten raw.The beet greens are high in vitamin A.Propagation Basic requirements Beets are cool season vegetables with a long growing season.
They grow best in cool climates but can tolerate some heat as well as some freezing. The optimum temperature for their growth is between 15.5 and 18.3Â°C (60â€“65Â°F).Beets grow best in a loose, well draining soil with a pH between 6.2 and 6.8 and should be planted in full sun for optimum development.Sowing Beets are directly seeded and can be planted as soon as the soil is workable in Spring.The soil should be prepared for planting by ensuring land is well prepared with good drainage and enough organic matter.The seeds are multi-germ clusters with two to five seeds.They are slow to germinate, so pre-soaking the seeds for 12 hours will encourage rapid and more even germination.Plant one seed every 2.5 cm (1 in) at a depth of 13 mm (0.5 in) in rows spaced 30â€“40 cm (12â€“16 in) apart.Keep the seedbed well watered.Seedlings should emerge in 5 to 17 days at temperatures between 10 and 24Â°C (50â€“75Â°F).
When seedlings have reached between 7 and 10 cm (3â€“4 in) in height, thin to a final spacing of 7â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in) between plants. For a continuous harvest, plant seeds every 2â€“3 weeks as long as the daytime temperature stays below 26.6Â°C (80Â°F).Most beet varieties mature in 55 to 70 days.Beetroot takes about two months to grow from sowing to maturity, mature height of the plant is about 9 cm.General care and maintenance Weeding Keep the area around your beet plants free of weeds, as they can compete for nutrients and water.Remove any weeds around plants by cultivating shallowly to avoid damaging the developing roots.Use mulch (such as straw or wood chips) to help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.Thinning Thin beet seedlings when they are about 2-3 inches tall to provide adequate spacing between plants.This prevents overcrowding, allowing roots to develop properly.Leave the healthiest-looking seedlings, spacing them 3-4 inches apart in rows.
Fertilizing Test your soil to determine its nutrient content, and fertilize accordingly. Beets generally benefit from well-balanced, fertile soil.Beets also require an adequate supply of nutrients, particularly phosphorus.Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic compost before planting.Avoid excessive nitrogen, as it can lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of root development.Crop Rotation Practice crop rotation to prevent soil depletion and reduce the risk of disease.Avoid planting beets in the same spot in consecutive growing seasons.Protection from Extreme Weather Beets prefer cool to moderate temperatures.If you're growing them in hot weather, consider providing some shade during the hottest parts of the day.Pest and Disease Management Keep an eye out for common beet pests such as aphids, leafhoppers, and leaf miners.Remove affected leaves or use organic pest control methods as needed.Practice crop rotation to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.
Beets are generally less susceptible to pests and diseases compared to some other crops, but it's still essential to monitor them regularly. In case of frost, cover young beet plants with row covers or cloths to protect them.Monitoring and Maintenance Regularly inspect your beet plants for signs of stress, disease, or pests.Early detection can help you address issues before they become severe.Remove any dead or diseased leaves to promote air circulation and overall plant health.Harvest beet greens before they reach 6 inches in length Beets are most tender when they are 1â€“2 inches in diameter Harvesting Young beet greens can be harvested for salads when they are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) high and older greens before they reach 15 cm (6 in) in length.Roots are also ready for harvest when the foliage starts to go limp.The roots are ready for harvest when they have reached 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter and are most tender before they exceed 7.5â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in).
Watering the soil the day before harvest or the day after rainfall makes pulling the beets easier. Pull beets out of the soil by firmly grasping the top and pulling the root out of the soil vertically.Alternatively, use a garden fork to dig the beets out of the soil.Cut the tops of the beets to 1.25â€“2.5 cm (0.5â€“1.0 in) above the root before storing the root.This helps keep the beets fresh.Beets can be stored for long periods of time if they are very cool and very damp.Once the top of the beets has been removed, roots are washed and stored in polythene bags to lengthen the shelf-life by reducing water loss during storage and transit.References Beet and Swiss Chard Production in California.University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources.Available at: http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/8096.pdf.[Accessed 06 November 14].

The tree produces clusters of white flowers and a fruit that resembles a pear-shaped orange. The fruit is green and turns yellow when ripe.Bergamot trees can reach up to 4 m (13.1 ft) in height and will remain productive for up to 60 years if managed well.Bergamot may also be referred to as bergamot orange or sour orange, and its origin is unknown, although it is almost exclusively grown in the coastal plains of southern Italy.Crop Details Scientific Name: Citrus bergamia Other Common Names: Bergamotto (Italian), bergamote (French), bergamotte (German), bergamot (Turkish), Ð±ÐµÑ€Ð³Ð°Ð¼Ð¾Ñ‚ (bergamot) (Russian) Bergamot orange tree Uses & Benefits Bergamot Content Bergamotâ€™s essential oil is known for its ability to effectively combatÂ stress, anxiety, depression, improve digestion, relieve pain and heal wounds.On the skincare front, the oil's antibacterial and anti-inflammatory attributes make it a valuable asset against conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis.
Bergamot's distinctive citrus flavor is a staple in Earl Grey tea and culinary applications. The oil produced by the flowers, leaves and rind of the fruit is used in eau de toilette, cologne and soap.The bitter fruit is used to make marmalade and to flavor liqueurs.Varities of Bergamot Bergamot, when referred to in the context of plants, often relates to two main types: Monarda didyma (Bee Balm) and Citrus bergamia (Bergamot Orange).Here are common varieties of both: Monarda didyma (Bee Balm) Jacob Cline: This variety features bright red, tubular flowers and stands out for its excellent mildew resistance.It's a favorite among gardeners and attracts pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.Prairie Night: Known for its deep purple or nearly black flowers, Prairie NightÂ is a striking addition to any garden.It also has a strong, pleasant aroma.Raspberry Wine: With its vibrant, raspberry-colored blooms, this cultivar adds a burst of color to gardens.
Its scent is reminiscent of raspberries, and it attracts pollinators. Balmyâ„¢ Series: This series includes various colors like pink, purple, and lavender.The compact size of these plants makes them ideal for small gardens or containers.Citrus bergamia (Bergamot Orange) Castagnaro: A popular Italian variety, 'Castagnaro' is known for its high-quality fruit and aromatic peel.It's primarily used in the production of Bergamot essential oil.Calabrese: Grown in the Calabria region of Italy, this variety is highly prized for its fragrant and flavorful fruit, making it a key ingredient in Earl Grey tea.Meyer Lemon Bergamot: This hybrid variety combines the traits of the Meyer lemon and bergamot.It offers sweeter and less acidic fruit with the signature bergamot aroma.Djerba Bergamot: Grown on the Tunisian island of Djerba, this bergamot variety is known for its sweet and aromatic peel, which is used in perfumery and culinary applications.
Propagation Basic requirements Bergamot oranges grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season. They will grow best at temperatures between 12.8 and 37.8Â°C (55â€“100Â°F) during the growing season and 1.7 to 10Â°C (35â€“50Â°F) during dormancy.Mature trees can survive short periods of freezing, whereas young trees will be killed.Trees should be protected from frosts and freezing conditions to prevent damage.The trees will also tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil.Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.The soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development.Trees require full sun and should be protected from wind, which can cause damage to the trees.Propagation Bergamot seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock, as seeds will not produce fruit true to type.
Grafting is the process by which a scion from one plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree. Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud.Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well.Budding Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6â€“9 mm/0.25â€“0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant).Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden.The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which they will be joined.It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees.
The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases, which can kill trees. The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks that are 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves.These budsticks can be stored for 2â€“3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.The simplest way to join the budwood to the rootstock is by T- budding.The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut should be approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground.Using a sharp knife, a 2.5â€“3.8 cm (1â€“1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark.A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a â€œT-shapeâ€​ The horizontal cut should be made at a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark.
Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9â€“2.5 cm (0.75â€“1.0 in) in length.Immediately insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant.Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.When the union is made and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem above the join, about 2/3 of the way through the stem.This cut should be made 2.5â€“3.9 cm (1.0â€“1.5 in) on the same side as the join.The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground.This process, known as "lopping,â€​ allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in length, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.
Planting seedlings Bergamot trees can be purchased as seedlings that have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in the spring, after all the danger of frost has passed in your area.Standard sized trees should be spaced 3.7â€“7.6 m (12â€“25 ft) apart in an area that receives full sunlight but is protected from strong winds, which can damage the trees.Planting against a south facing wall will help protect the tree in cooler climates.General care and maintenance Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established.During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish themselves in the soil.Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3â€“7 days.The soil should be moist, but not wet.Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently.
Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year. Harvesting Harvesting bergamot, whether it's Monarda didyma (Bee Balm) or Citrus bergamia (Bergamot Orange), involves careful timing and consideration of the specific plant type.For Monarda didyma, which is often grown for its striking flowers and aromatic leaves, the best time to harvest is when the blooms are in full glory.To maintain the plant's health and encourage continuous flowering, it's advisable to trim the flowering stems, cutting them just above a pair of leaves while ensuring not to remove more than one-third of the plant's height at a time.On the other hand, Citrus bergamia, primarily cultivated for its fragrant peel, is harvested during the winter months when the fruit is ripe.The fruit should be gently hand-picked to avoid damage to the tree and then carefully peel the bergamot, capturing the valuable essential oils.
Proper harvesting methods are essential to maintaining the quality and utility of the harvested material.

The plant features simple, alternating leaves with an oval shape and produces clusters, or spikes, of 50 to 150 flowers. These flowers give rise to small, spherical green fruits that ripen to red.Each stem has the potential to produce 20-30 of these spikes.While black pepper can grow to a height of 10 meters (33 feet) in the wild, under cultivation, it is usually maintained at a more manageable 3-4 meters (10-13 feet).Black pepper is a perennial plant with a lifespan of over 30 years, and it typically has a commercial lifespan of 12â€“20 years.This versatile spice is native to south and southeast Asia.White, green and black peppercorns Black pepper fruits and foliage Black pepper spikes Black pepper Content Black pepper spike Black pepper growing on a tree Varieties Among the numerous pepper varieties, only a select few are important as spices.These include: Black pepper hails from India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
Bengal pepper originates in the mountainous regions of the lower Himalayas. Java pepper is native to Malaysia and Indonesia.Ashanti pepper is indigenous to tropical Africa.Kubeben pepper is found in Indonesia and Malaysia.Uses Black pepper plants are cultivated to produce black, white, and green pepper.The processing methods vary for each type:- Black pepper is the result of drying the fruit to produce the familiar black peppercorns.White pepper is produced by soaking the fruits in water for about a week to recover the seed from the decomposed fruit.Green pepper is produced by drying unripe fruit in a way that retains its green color.Green peppercorns are often preserved by pickling.Pepper is one of the oldest classic spices and is used as an ingredient in many spice mixtures, such as curry.
Black pepper, white pepper, and green pepper all derive from the piper nigrum plant.Â The distinct types of pepper are obtained by harvesting at different stages of ripeness and applying different processing techniques. Pepper seeds contain various components, including essential oil, piperine, chavicine, piperidine, fatty oils, resin, starch, and water.The alkaloid piperine is primarily responsible for the sharp taste associated with pepper.Propagation Black pepper can be propagated using three main methods: dry seeds, cuttings, or stolons.Cuttings are the most common method for commercial production.They are typically taken from the secondary runners of the plant and should have one or two leaves.These cuttings are rooted in a seedbed and then transplanted when the plant has 4-7 new leaves.In cultivation, a trellis is used to support the plant, and the trellis should be at least 4 meters (13 feet) high.
When planting, black pepper should be spaced at 8 Ã— 8 meters (26 Ã— 26 feet), meaning 8 meters between individual plants and 8 meters between rows. Methods of propagation i).Seed Propagation While propagation using seeds is possible, it's less common on conventional plantations due to the lengthy germination process.Germination from seeds can lead to genetic diversity, including male and female plants.Seeds are typically obtained by soaking fully ripened berries in water for 2-3 days, then removing the meat and drying them in the shade.They are then planted in moist, shaded beds and will germinate after about 30 days.Transplanting to their final sites occurs after they have produced four leaves.ii).Cuttings Propagation: The most widely used method of propagation is through cuttings taken from the terminal area of a healthy parent plant.These cuttings are selected after removing the vegetation apex, leaves, and lateral shoots from the 3rd to the 7th knots.
Cuttings are planted in a seedling bed at an angle of 45Â° with 3-4 knots, leaving the uppermost leaves. The seedbed must be kept moist and shaded.The cuttings usually take root after about 2 months, with a success rate of approximately 30%.They can then be transplanted to their final sites.iii).Rooted Pepper Cuttings propagation: Another method involves using rooted cuttings, where the shoots are directly attached to the plant itself.The process is similar to standard cuttings, but a layer of moist moss or humus is bound around the 7th knot and secured with plastic foil.After approximately 2 months, the shoot is cut away and acclimatized in a polyethylene bag in the planting bed before being transplanted to its final site.This method yields a higher success rate for shoot rooting but involves more work.Climatic condition for black pepper cultivation Black pepper (Piper nigrum) thrives in specific climatic conditions, which are crucial for its successful cultivation.
These conditions encompass various factors, including soil, water temperature, spacing, and sunlight. Here's an overview of each aspect: a).Soil: Black pepper grows best in well-draining soils rich in organic matter.The ideal soil pH for black pepper is around 5.5 to 6.5.It requires good soil aeration and texture for healthy root development.b).Water Temperature: Black pepper is a tropical crop and prefers warm temperatures.The crop tolerates temperatures between 10Â°C and 40Â°C.The ideal temperature range for black pepper is 23Â°C to 32Â°C, with an average of 28Â°C.Optimum soil temperature for root growth is around 26Â°C.c).Spacing: Adequate spacing is crucial for black pepper vines to grow well.Typically, black pepper vines need about 3-4 meters of spacing between them, as they are climbers and require room to spread and climb.d).Sunlight: Black pepper plants require partial to full sunlight for healthy growth.They need at least 4-5 hours of direct sunlight daily.
In regions with intense heat, providing some shade during the hottest part of the day can be beneficial. Understanding and optimizing these climatic conditions is essential for the successful cultivation of black pepper.These factors contribute to the quality and yield of this popular spice.Care and Maintenance of Black Pepper Plants Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a popular spice known for its pungent flavor.Growing and maintaining black pepper plants can be a rewarding endeavor, but it requires proper care and attention to detail.Here's a guide on how to care for and maintain black pepper plants: 1.Planting: Choose a suitable location with well-draining soil and partial sunlight.Plant black pepper vines in rows or on trellises, allowing them to climb.2.Watering: Maintain consistent moisture, as pepper plants prefer slightly damp soil.Avoid waterlogging, which can harm the roots.3.Pests and Diseases: Pests like aphids and scale insects are rampant; keep an eye on them.
You can remove dead or diseased branches to avoid diseases. You will have to treat diseases like root rot promptly.4.Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer with micronutrients regularly.Use organic matter to enrich the soil.5.Pruning: Trim and prune the vines to encourage bushier growth.Harvesting Black Pepper Black pepper harvesting is a crucial step in the spice production process.Here's how to harvest black pepper: 1.Timing: Harvest black pepper when the berries turn from green to red or yellow, depending on the variety.Avoid picking unripe or overripe berries.2.Methods: Handpick the berries or use tools like shears for larger harvests.Be gentle to prevent damaging the vines.3.Post-Harvest Processing: Thresh the berries to separate them from the stems.Blanch, dry, clean, grade, and package the peppercorns for market distribution.
Prevention and Regulation of Pests and Diseases in Organic Pepper Cultivation: Choice of Site: Select a site that is well-drained and avoids waterlogging. Ensure the presence of ample organic material in the soil.Establishment of a Diversified Mixed Cultivation System: Implement a mixed cultivation system that includes a variety of crops.This diversity can help reduce the risk of pests and diseases by disrupting their host plants.Removal of Diseased Plant Material: Regularly remove any diseased or infected plant material to prevent the spread of pests and diseases.Light/Shade Management and Organic Material Enrichment: Manage the balance of light and shade in the cultivation area.Enrich the organic material with tree pruning to improve soil health.Constant Renewal of the Site: Consider ongoing site renewal to maintain soil fertility and reduce the risk of disease buildup over time.
Lignin-Rich Mulch Material: Use lignin-rich mulch material to stimulate the growth of actinomycetes in the soil. Actinomycetes are natural antagonists to pathogens like Fusarium.These measures are crucial for maintaining a healthy, disease-resistant organic pepper cultivation system.They focus on proactive steps to prevent and manage pests and diseases while promoting soil health and biodiversity.References Anandaraj, M.& Sarma, Y.R.(1995).Diseases of Black pepper ( Piper nigrum L.) and their management.Journal of Spices and Aromatic Crops.4 (1): 17-23.Available at: http://220.227.138.214:8080/dspace/bitstream/123456789/150/1/Vol.IV%2BNo.1%2B.[Accessed 07 November 14].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Piper nigrum datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/41374.[Accessed 07 November 14].Paid subscription required .Nelson, S.C.& Cannon-Eger, K.T.(2011).Farm and forestry production and marketing profile for Black pepper ( Piper nigrum ).

Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is the use of resistant blackberry varieties; if plants are already infected but disease is not yet severe then remove and destroy any abnormal blossom clusters; old canes should be removed and destroyed immediately following harvest; fungicide application may limit damage; disease can also be controlled by only harvesting berries in alternating years, completely destroying the above ground part of the plants in the years in between; the planting may be split in two so that there is a harvest of fruit each year while the other half is cut back.Botrytis fruit rot Botrytis cinerea gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) mycelium with conidia Rotting fruit covered with fungal growth of Botrytis cinerea (right) and Rhizopus sp.
(left) Botrytis mycelium on blackberry fruit Symptoms Canes are bleached in appearance and develop flattened masses of black fungal fruiting bodies where grey mycelium and spores develop; flowers may become infected and become blighted by the fungus; infected drupelets on the fruit may develop a watery rot which is replaced by grayish brown fungal structures; if berries are left on the vines they become mummified. Cause Fungi Comments Emergence of Botrytis fruit rot is favored by cool and wet conditions; physical damage to fruit increases likelihood of infection.Management Promote air circulation around vines by using trellises or training the vines; avoid over fertilizing plants; protective fungicides can be used to control the disease and should be applied at intervals of 7-14 days from early bloom right through to harvest.
Cane and Leaf Rust Kuehneola uredinis Kuehneola uredinis rust on the stem Rust symptoms on stem cane and leaf rust (Kuehneola uredinis) spore mass on cane Symptoms The infected plant cane and leaves exhibit the small, lemon-yellow pustules. As the disease progress infected cane will show cracking and drying, whereas the leaves become spotted and dries off.Cause Fungus Comments It is a non systemic disease.Management Prune out and burn infected cane and leaves.Orange rust Gymnoconia peckiana Orange aecia bordered by white ruptured peridium.Orange rust fruiting bodies (Aecia) on lower side of leaf Orange rust infected blackberry leaves Numerous bright orange pustules developing on the undersides of leaves.
Blackberry orange rust Healthy blackberry (left) compared with blackberry infected with orange rust (right) Infected foliage covered with aecial pustules Orange rust infected leaves Orange rust pustules Symptoms New growth is weak and spindly and lacks spines; leaves are stunted and distorted and are pale in color; waxy pustules develop on leaf undersides and turn orange and powdery; infected leaves eventually drop from the plant. Cause Fungus Comments Wild brambles and dewberries may act as a reservoir for the disease; fungus overwinters in the host plant.Management Infected plants should be removed in entirety; prune and burn fruiting canes after harvest; improve air circulation around foliage by pruning and trellising vines; spread of rust can be minimized by applying foliar fungicides wen the orange spores are being produced; if well managed, the disease is not usually serious.
Powdery mildew Podosphaera macularis Symptoms Light green chlorotic patches on foliage which later develops into powdery gray patches; leaves may be twisted or distorted; if infection is severe then shoots may become spindly with small leaves which cup upwards. Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in buds or on surface of canes; emergence of the disease is favored by warm, dry weather conditions.Management If powdery mildew is known to be a problem in a particular area then avoid planting susceptible varieties; varieties bred in the US state of Arkanasas, such as Navaho, Apache, and Arapaho, are known to be quite resistant to powdery mildew.Category : Bacterial Crown gall Agrobacterium tumefaciens Crown gall on cane Crown gall infesting cane Stand dieback due to crown gall Crown gall on Munger black raspberry.
Stand dieback from crown gall Gall on blackberry root system Symptoms Galls on canes and branches above ground or on root system; galls have a rough surface and a spongy texture; galls may darken and develop cracks as they mature; galls may have little or no effect on growth but can cause a reduction in vigor and death of plants. Cause Bacterium Comments Bacteria most commonly enter the plant through wounds created by pruning or from wind damage; the bacterium causes a proliferation of undifferentiated plant cells which form a gall.Management Avoid planting in areas known to have been affected by crown gall for a period of a least three years; if an infected plant is found, destroy it immediately; a biological control agent called Galltron is available for use in blackberries which contains a nonpathogenic strain of Agrobacterium which is antagonistic to the bacterium which causes crown gall; roots of new plantings are dipped in the substance prior to planting to protect them.
Pests Category : Insects Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Beetle feeding on foliage Japanese beetles and damage Adult beetles feeding on foliage Japanese beetle Japanese beetles mating and feeding on raspberry leaves and fruit Symptoms Leaves skeletonized (only veins remaining); flowers and buds damaged; plant damage may be extensive; adult insect is a metallic green-bronze beetle with tufts of white hair protruding from under wing covers on each side of the body; adult beetles are approximately 13 mm in length; larvae are cream-white grubs which develop in the soil. Cause Insect Comments One beetle generation every 1-2 years; pheromone traps may actually attract more beetles to home gardens and should generally be avoided; beetle overwinters as larvae in soil; beetle has an extensive range of over 300 host plants.
Management If beetles were a problem in the previous year, use floating row covers to protect plants or spray kaolin clay; adult beetles can be hand picked from plants and destroyed by placing in soapy water; parasitic nematodes can be applied to soil to reduce the number of overwintering grubs; insecticidal soaps or neem oil can help reduce beetle populations. Leafrollers (e.g.Omnivorous leafroller) Platynota stultana Leafroller larvae Adult insect Omnivorous leafroller (Platynota stultana) Symptoms Leaves of plant rolled and tied together with silk webbing; feeding damage to rolled leaves; defoliation of plant; silk webbing may also be present on fruits and fruits may have substantial scarring from feeding damage; larvae wriggle vigorously when disturbed and may drop from plant on a silken thread.Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a moth which can fly over several miles to find suitable hosts; alfalfa and sugar beet are good hosts.
Management Monitor plants regularly for signs of infestation; remove weeds from plant bases as they can act as hosts for leafrollers; avoid planting pepper in areas where sugarbeet or alfalfa are grown nearby; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; apply sprays carefully to ensure that treatment reaches inside rolled leaves. Rednecked cane borer Agrilus ruficollis Rednecked cane borer (Agrilus ruficollis) adult Galls on canes Rednecked cane borers feeding inside Blackberry cane Tunnel in cane made by rednecked cane borer Rednecked cane borer adult Redneck cane borer mating Symptoms Galls on canes which are usually 2.5-7.6 cm (1- 3 in) in length; canes may die over winter above the galls; bud break may be delayed the following spring; canes with galls often do not produce fruit; adult insect is a slender, metallic black beetle; larvae are white, flat-headed grubs.
Cause Insect Comments Female beetles deposit eggs on bark of canes and larvae burrow into primocanes. Management Canes with galls should be pruned out and burned or buried to destroy overwintering larvae; remove any wild brambles nearby which may act as a reservoir for cane borer populations; if chemical treatment is required (generally if more than About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms 5% of canes are affected) then it should be applied after bloom to limit damage to bees.About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Blueberry is a crown forming, woody, perennial shrub in the family Ericaceae grown for its fruits, or berries, of the same name.
The blueberry plant possesses oval or elliptical leaves which grow alternately on the stems. The stems, or twigs, are yellow/green in color and turn reddish in winter.Flowers are bell shaped and can be either white or pink, occurring in clusters of 8 to 10 flowers.Berries are blue to black in color and 0.6â€“1.3 cm (0.25â€“0.5 in) in size.Lowbush blueberry plants (including Vaccinium angustifolium ) are smaller in stature, reaching heights of 35 to 60 cm (13.8â€“23.6 in) and with proper management can produce fruit for between 40 and 50 years.Lowbush blueberries are also sometimes referred to as Maine, New Hampshire or wild blueberry and are native to eastern/central Canada and northeastern United States.Highbush blueberries (including Vaccinium corymbosum ) are generally 2â€“3 m (6.6â€“9.8 ft) in height but can reach up to 5 m (16.4 ft) and may also be referred to as huckleberry or swamp blueberry.
Highbush blueberry accounts for most of the commercial production of blueberry fruit and is also native only to North America. Fall foliage Blueberry blossoms Flooded blueberry bog Blueberry field Foliage Ripening berries Blueberry Content Foliage Blueberries Blueberry fruit on bush Uses Blueberries can be eaten fresh or can be dried or baked for further processing.Frozen or pureed berries are commonly used to make jams and preserves and baked goods.Lowbush blueberry is commonly used to make wine.Propagation Lowbush blueberry grows best in well-drained, acidic soils with a pH between 4.5 and 4.8 and should be planted in early Spring as purchased plants or as â€œplugsâ€​ (a small cutting, including root, from an established bush).The newly planted blueberry should be covered in a couple of inches of mulch to conserve moisture in the soil.Any flowers produced by the plants should be removed for at least one year after planting to promote vigor and new growth.
Plants should be pruned by cutting close to the ground and a pruned plant will not produce any fruit in the first year, but in the second year subsequent to pruning their should be a good yield. Growth can be stimulated by field-burning, as these plants are very fire-tolerant.Highbush blueberry can be propagated from seeds, cuttings from an established plant or bare root and should be planted in late Fall.Blueberry plants grow best in well drained, highly acidic soils with a pH between 4.5 and 5.8.The plants have a shallow root system and should be planted in a hole at least twice as large as the existing root system and mulched with a 7-10 cm (3-4 in) layer of organic mulch.The first year of blossom should be removed to encourage new growth and it is also recommended to do the same in the second year.Plants should be pruned annually, particularly after the first two years, to promote plant vigour and remove diseased or broken canes.
Irrigation is recommended due to the shallow root system and greatly promotes the fruit yield this practice is highly recommended if growing commercially.

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Botrytis blossom blight (Gray mold) Botrytis cinerea Blighted blossoms on lowbush blueberry caused by Botrytis cinerea Symptoms Corollas of expanded blossoms appear blighted; brown lesions on leaves which have come into contact with infected blossoms; infected blossoms do not produce fruit; in large fields, severe infedctions are often visible as brown patches Cause Fungus Comments Can be very damaging to lowbush blueberries; fungus overwinters in fruits, stems and leaves of plant; disease emergence is favored by wet weather; severe outbreaks can occur after wet periods lasting several days or more Management Disease can be controlled by application of appropriate fungicides, if available, at mid-bloom and late bloom stage Mummy berry Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi Mummified fruit which had dropped from the plant Mummy berry symptoms on blueberry fruits Mummy berry symptoms on blueberry fruits Infected berries: berry on left has been completely transformed to fungal fruiting body Mummy berry symptoms on blueberry fruits Infected fruits Symptoms Drooping of new leaves and shoots in Spring; rapid browning of upper surface of affected shoots and leaf midribs and veins; death of infected shoots,leaves and flowers 24-72 hours after appearance of brown discoloration; after initial symptoms in Spring, plants become symptomless until fruit development; infected berries are cream or pink in color and turn tan or gray; berries become shriveled and hard; shriveled skin of fruit breaks down to expose black rind of fungal tissue Cause Fungus Comments Disease affects highbush, lowbush and rabbiteye blueberry varieties; bees can aid the transfer of the fungus from infected to healthy flowers Management Plant disease-free, dormant plants; remove or bury mummified fruit, if burying fruit cover with at least an inch of soil; application of appropriate foliar fungicides are very effective at controlling the disease in commercial plantations Powdery mildew Erysiphe vaccinii Powdery mildew symptoms Lesions caused by powdery mildew on lowbush blueberry foliage Powdery mildew on rabbiteye blueberry Symptoms White fluffy growth on upper surfaces of leaves or lower leaf surface; leaves may be puckered in appearance; leaves may develop chlorotic spots with red borders; leaves may drop from plant Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by warm, dry conditions Management Plant resistant highbush blueberry varieties; apply appropriate foliar fungicides, if available Shoestring Blueberry shoestring virus (BBSSV) Symptoms Elongated reddish streaks on green stems; purplish red leaves; cupped leaves; leaves may be elongated or strap-like; reddish-purple fruit Cause Virus Comments Infected plants do not show symptoms of disease for 4 years or more.
During this latent period the virus can be spread to other plants making the removal of visibly infected bushes an ineffective control method; virus is transmitted by aphids Management One of the most effective methods of preventing the spread of the virus is to time applications of insecticides to coincide with aphid emergence; the first application is usually made in late May or early June; any equipment used to apply insecticides should be cleaned thoroughly before moving to a new area Stem canker Botryosphaeria corticus Red lesions on blueberry stems caused by stem canker infection Symptoms Initial symptoms appear as red lesions on green stems which become swollen and conical; on rabbiteye blueberry varieties lesions are initially brown sunken spots; in susceptible varieties lesions develop into large swollen cankers with deep cracks after 2-3 years of infection; if the variety is very susceptible the cankers may kill the stem Cause Fungus Comments Infection occurs in late Spring; spores are spread by wind; at lower temperatures the disease may be limited to small red flecks Management The most important method of controlling stem canker is to plant resistant varieties in areas where the disease occurs as fungicides are largely ineffective; no varieties of highbush blueberry are resistant to all strains of the disease; infected wood should not be used for propogation Category : Oomycete Phytophthora root rot Phytophthora cinnamoni Symptoms Yellowing leaves; lack of new growth on plants; highbush varieties become stunted and turn red; rabbit eye varieties may become chlorotic and srop leaves Cause Oomycete Comments Disease emergence is favored by water-logged soils and warm temperatures; disease is spread by movement of contaminated water and soil Management The best method of controlling phytophthora root rot is through the use of good cultural practices: plant blueberries in well-draining soils or in raised beds; sanitize all tool sand equipment regularly; avoid transferring soil between sites Pests Category : Mites Blueberry bud mite Acalitus vaccinii Damage caused by blueberry bud mite Damage caused by blueberry bud mite Damage caused by blueberry bud mite Symptoms Blistered red scales on buds; misshapen flowers, small leaves and fruit; damage may lead to poor growth and yields; mites are microscopic and difficult to see with the naked eye Cause Arachnid Comments Mite eggs are laid in the bug scales and adult mites migrate down stem to feed Management Control of mites can be difficult as they are protected from pesticides by bud scales; miticides are most efffective when applied just after harvest when the buds have not yet formed as they are more exposed to the chemical Category : Insects Flea beetle (Blueberry flea beetle) Altica sylvia Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insect Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Adult Japanese beetle and damage to blueberry foliage Adult Japanese beetle and damage to blueberry foliage Symptoms Leaves skeletonized (only veins remaining); flowers and buds damaged; plant damage may be extensive; adult insect is a metallic green-bronze beetle with tufts of white hair protruding from under wing covers on each side of the body; adult beetles are approximately 13 mm in length; larvae are cream-white grubs which develop in the soil Cause Insect Comments One beetle generation every 1-2 years; pheromone traps may actually attract more beetles to home gardens and should generally be avoided; beetle overwinters as larvae in soil; beetle has an extensive range of over 300 host plants Management If beetles were a problem in the previous year, use floating row covers to protect plants or spray kaolin clay; adult beetles can be hand picked from plants and destroyed by placing in soapy water; parasitic nematodes can be applied to soil to reduce the number of overwintering grubs; insecticidal soaps or neem oil can help reduce beetle populations Sharpnosed leafhopper Scaphytopius magdalensis Symptoms There are very few outward symptoms of feeding by this insect but they are considered a major pest as they transmit a mycoplasma-like organism that causes blueverry stunt; the adult insect is small and brown reaching approximately 5 mm in length with small cream colored patches on the body and wings; both adult and nymphal stages have a pointed head Cause Insect Comments In Southern regions, the sharpnosed leafhopper may undergo three generations per year; adult insects are capable of flying long distances and will also feed on huckleberry Management Plantations of blueberry can be monitored for sharpnose leafhoppers through the use of yellow sticky traps; insecticides registered for use on blueberry are generally quite effective at reducing leafhopper populations and should be applied to coincide with leafhopper dispersal to limit the spread of blueberry stunt Thrips (Various spp) e.g.

The brazil nut tree is very large with a long straight trunk which is 1â€“2 m (3.3â€“6.6 ft) in diameter. The tree only branches in the upper regions and the long branches are covered in large, leathery, oblong shaped leaves which form a spreading canopy.The tree produces large, pale yellow or greenish flowers and a round fruit which is approximately 15 cm (6 in) in diameter.The fruit has a thick hard shell and contains 18 to 24 angular seeds (nuts).The large edible kernel is protected by a thin, woody shell which has a wrinkled appearance.Brazil nut trees can reach a height of 25â€“56 m (82â€“184 ft) and can live for well over 500 years.Brazil nut may also be referred to as cream nut or butter nut and originates from the Amazonian rainforest.

Propagation Biology and ecology of the brazil nut Brazil nut trees grow in areas of tropical rainforests which have a dry period, usually at low altitude.The nuts are harvested almost exclusively from naturally occurring trees although in some parts of the Amazon, plantations are being developed.Brazil nut seedlings develop in the forest understory and require a gap to emerge in the forest canopy to provide the light required to develop to maturity.Trees will flower after 5 or 6 years and only begin to bear fruit after a period of 10â€“20 years.
Flowering occurs at the beginning of the dry season and the flowers are pollinated by a large species of bee. The fruit takes 15 months to reach maturity and is harvested in the wet season by collecting as soon as it falls from the tree.Trees have been successfully propagated from seed and planted into a plantation.A major obstacle to plantation production of Brazil nut is the difficulty of attracting the correct species of pollinator.Harvesting Brazil nuts are harvested during the rainy season and the fallen fruits are collected from the forest floor.Collection is usually carried out in the morning to reduce the chance of being hit by falling fruits which can cause severe injury.The fruits are hard and must be hacked open with a machete in order to collect the nuts from inside for further processing.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Bertholletia excelsa datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10243.[Accessed 07 November 14].

Broad bean is a an annual vetch reaching between 0.5â€“1.8 m (1.6â€“6 ft) tall. There are often multiple stems originating from the base of the plant and the compound leaves are often broad, oval shaped, and come groups of 6 leaflets to a stem.The flowers are white with purple markings.Between 1 and 4 pods develop from each flower cluster.The beans can be greenish black, brown or black in color.Vicia faba may also be referred to as bell-bean, fava bean or horsebean and originates from the Mediterranean or in South-West Asia.Purple broad bean variety Broad bean pods Broad bean foliage Broad bean pods Broad bean plant in flower Uses Broad bean is cultivated for both animal and human consumption, soil development, and medicinal uses .It can be served fresh, dried, canned, or as a substitute for meat and skim-milk.Broad bean is often used as either forage (leaves, plant material) or silage (fermented, high-moisture fodder) for animals.
Using broad bean as a spring cover crop allows Broad bean, dry Content for protection against erosion, and can be tilled back into the soil as green manure. The taproot also has the added benefit of being able to break-up hard compacted soil.Propagation Basic requirements Broad bean is a cool-season crop and should be grown in early Spring or late summer to avoid high summer temperatures.Broad beans will grow best at soil temperatures between 15.5 and 18.3Â°C (60â€“65Â°F) and will not grow well at temperature below below 4.4Â°C (40Â°F) or above 23.8Â°C (75Â°F).Broad bean is particularly susceptible to high temperatures during the summer which make the plants unproductive.Broad beans will grow best in a fertile, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.75 positioned in full sunlight.
Sowing seeds Broad beans should be direct seeded in the garden in Spring as soon as the soil is workable and temperature is above 4.4Â°C (40Â°F) with the optimum temperature for germination being between 10 and 21Â°C (50â€“70Â°F). A second planting can be made in early Fall in areas with moderate winters.Seeds should be planted 2.5â€“5.0 (1â€“2 in) deep allowing 7.5â€“15 cm (3â€“6 in between plants and approximately 0.6 m ( 2 ft) between rows.General care and maintenance Broad bean plants are bush-like but can grow quite tall and will benefit from staking to provide some support and keep them from flopping over due to the weight of the pods.Keep soil moist during flowering to ensure optimum pod development and soak ground thoroughly if plants come into flower during a dry spell.As they are legumes, broad beans generally do not require additional fertilization as long as they have sufficient root nodules.
Nodulation can be promoted by inoculating seeds with additional Rhizobacteria prior to planting. Harvesting Broad beans are ready to harvest when the pods are fat and full and beginning to droop from the plant due to the weight of the seeds inside.Seeds can be dried either by leaving pods on the plant until they begin to shrivel or by picking and hanging up to dry out.Broad beans will benefit from staking to support the weight of the pods References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Vicia faba datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/56364.[Accessed 07 November 14].Paid subscription required .Duke, J.A.(1983).Vicia faba L..Purdue University Center for New Crops and Plant Products.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/default.html.[Accessed 07 November 14].Free to access .Schwartz, H.F., Steadman, J.R., Hall, R.& Forster, R.L.(2005) Compendium of Bean Diseases.Available at: http://www.apsnet.org/apsstore/shopapspress/Pages/43275.aspx.

The broccoli plant has a thick green stalk, or stem, which gives rise to thick, leathery, oblong leaves which are gray-blue to green in color. The plant produces large branching green flower heads covered with numerous white or yellow flowers.Broccoli can be annual or biennial depending on the variety and can grow to 1 m (3.3 ft) in height.Broccoli may also be referred to as sprouting broccoli and likely originates from the Mediterranean although the exact location has not been determined.Close-up of broccoli flower head Purple broccoli variety Broccoli plant Broccoli side shoots Broccoli head forming Broccoli Uses Broccoli heads are consumed after boiling or fresh in salads.It can be processed for freezing and drying.Broccoli Content Propagation Basic requirements Broccoli is a cool season crop which can be grown both in spring and in fall.The plants thrive in cool climates and should be planted for fall in areas with hot summers.
Broccoli grows best in moist, fertile soil with a slightly acidic pH between between 6.0 and 7.0 and at temperatures between 15.5 and 18Â°C (60â€“65Â°F). Broccoli has a high nitrogen requirement and due to the reduced activity of soil microbes in late fall and winter, organic matter should be added to the soil throughout the year to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients when broccoli is planted.In addition, broccoli requires regular water, especially during drought, to prevent the plants from going to seed.Plant broccoli in full sun to ensure optimum head size.Sowing seeds Broccoli can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants.Spring plantings should be made 2â€“3 weeks before the last frost date in your area and Fall plantings should be made approximately 100 days before the first Fall frost.
Sow seed 1.3 cm (0.5 in) deep in small groups of 2â€“3 seeds and about a week after emergence, thin to a final spacing of 30â€“60 cm (12â€“24 in) within the row, allowing 90 cm (36 in) between rows. Keep soil evenly moist after planting.If starting indoors, plant seed in peat pots to minimize disturbance to the roots when transplanting.Seedling can be planted outdoors when they are 3â€“4 weeks old at the same time as seeds are planted using the spacing detailed above.Plant transplants slightly deeper in the ground than they currently are in their pot and keep soil moist to ensure good fertility.General care and maintenance Broccoli has a very shallow root system and cultivating the soil around the plants to remove weeds should be avoided.Provide the plants with adequate and even moisture (about 2 in a week) to keep plants fertile and prevent them from bolting and avoid wetting the flower heads as they develop.
Mulching around the plants helps to conserve soil moisture and reduces the soil temperature. Harvesting Broccoli is ready to harvest when the flower buds are firm and packed tightly in the head.Harvest before the buds open by cutting the stalk of the head at a 45Â° angle about 13â€“20 cm (5â€“8 in) below the head.Side-shoots will continue to produce after the first harvest.Broccoli transplants Broccoli seedlings References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Brassica oleracea var.italica datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10094.[Accessed 07 November 14].Paid subscription required .Drost, D.& Johnson, M.(2010).Broccoli in the Garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/HG_Garden_2005-01.pdf.[Accessed 07 November 14].Free to access .Hardin, N.C.(1996).Growing Broccoli.West Virginia University Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://www.wvu.edu/~exten/infores/pubs/homgardn/broc.pdf.

Cool moist conditions favor infection. If stems become infected they will develop white to grayish lesions.Sclerotia will eventually develop inside of infected stems, and if conditions are wet sclerotia will also develop on the outside of the stems also Wind borne spores will land on petals that have fallen onto leaves and stems.These spores colonizes the petals and afterwards will infect the plant itself.Eventually a white fluffy fungal mat can be seen along with sclerotia Symptoms Irregular, necrotic gray lesions on leaves; white-gray leions on stems; reduced pod set; shattering seed pods Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors moderate to cool temperatures and high humidity Management Rotate crop to non-hosts (e.g.
cereals) for at least 3 years; control weeds; avoid dense growth by planting in adequately spaced rows; apply appropriate foliar fungicides White rust Albugo candida Symptoms White pustules on cotyledons, leaves, stems and/or flowers which coalesce to form large areas of infection; leaves may roll and thicken Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive for long periods of time in dry conditions; disease spread by wind Management Rotate crops; plant only disease-free seed; apply appropriate fungicide if disease becomes a problem Category : Bacterial Black leg Phoma lingam Symptoms Damping-off of seedlings; round or irregularly shaped gray necrotic lesions on leaves with dark margins; lesions may be covered in pink masses in favorable weather conditions Cause Fungus Comments Favors warm, wet conditions;

spots may develop numerous fruiting bodies which give them a black appearance or develop a concentric pattern; heavily infected leaves may dry up and curl inwards Cause Fungus Comments Ring spot requires cool, moist conditions to survive; disease symptoms typically develop in the fall and the peak of the infection occurs in winter Management Refrain from planting in areas known to have had disease previously; rotate crop to non-brassicas; sanitize tools and equipment regularly; apply appropriate fungicide if disease is identified in crop Pests Category : Insects Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella Pupa Diamonback moth larva feeding on broccoli leaf Diamonback moth Larvae Symptoms Young larvae feed between upper and lower leaf surface and may be visible when they emerge from small holes on the underside of the leaf; older larvae leave large, irregularly shaped shotholes on leaf undersides, may leave the upper surface intact; larvae may drop from the plant on silk threads if the leaf is disturbed; larvae are small (1 cm/0.3 in) and tapered at both ends; larvae have to prolegs at the rear end that are arranged in a distinctive V-shape Cause Insect Comments Larvae take between 10 and 14 days to mature and spin a loose, gauze-like cocoon on leaves or stems to pupate Management Larvae can be controlled organically by applications of Bacillus thurengiensis or Entrust; application of appropriate chemical insecticide is only necessary if larvae are damaging the growing tips of the plants Flea beetle (Crucifer flea beetle) Phyllotreta cruciferae Flea beetles on broccoli leaf Damage to broccoli leaf caused by Crucifer flea beetle Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insect Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Large cabbage white (Cabbageworm) Pieres rapae Broccoli plant damaged by cabbage white feeding Cabbage white larva on broccoli leaf Symptoms Large ragged holes in leaves;

The plant has long, smooth and leathery leaves which can be green to purple in color and are arranged alternately on the stem. The sprouts form at the base of each leaf, in a long, spiral stem.The edible portion of the crop is the bud, which is a small cabbage-like head.It is a light green to green/blue in color.The plant is biennial but grown as an annual and can reach 0.6â€“1 m (2â€“3 ft) in height with a spread of 0.5â€“0.6 m (1.5â€“2 ft).Brussel sprouts may also be simply referred to as 'sprouts' and they originated from Northern Europe.Developing sprouts Brussels sprout foliage Field of Brussels sprouts Brussels sprout foliage Developing sprouts on the stem of a Brussels sprout plant Brussels sprout plants Uses Brussel sprouts are most commonly eaten cooked as a vegetable.They may also be pickled in vinegar.Brussels sprouts Content Propagation Basic requirements Brussels sprouts are a cool season crop which can be grown both in Spring and in Fall.
The plants thrive in cool climates, maturing in cool or lightly frosty weather. In areas with hot summers, they should be planted for a Fall harvest.Brussels sprouts grow best in moist, fertile, well-draining soil with a slightly acidic pH between between 6.0 and 6.5 and at temperatures between 7 and 24Â°C (45â€“75Â°F), with optimum growth occurring at 15â€“18Â°C (59â€“64Â°F).Brussels sprouts have a high nitrogen requirement and due to the reduced activity of soil microbes in late fall and winter, organic matter should be added to the soil throughout the year to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients when sprouts are planted.Plant Brussels sprouts in an area that receives at least six hours of full sunlight for optimum growth and development.Sowing seeds Brussels sprouts can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants.
Spring plantings should be made 2â€“3 weeks before the last frost date in your area and Fall plantings should be made approximately 4 months before the first Fall frost. Sow seed 1.3 cm (0.5 in) deep in small groups of 2â€“3 seeds and about a week after emergence, thin to a final spacing of 60 cm (24 in) within the row, allowing 76 cm (30 in) between rows.Keep soil evenly moist after planting.If starting indoors, plant seed in peat pots to minimize disturbance to the roots when transplanting.Seedling can be planted outdoors when they are 3â€“4 weeks old at the same time as seeds are planted using the spacing detailed above.Plant transplants slightly deeper in the ground than they currently are in their pot and keep soil moist to ensure good fertility.General care and maintenance Brussels sprouts are sensitive to boron deficiency which can cause the plants to develop hollow stems and small buds.The deficiency can be corrected by adding boron to the soil.
Brussels sprouts should be provided with adequate and even moisture (1.0 to 1.5 inches a week) to keep plants fertile and prevent them from bolting. Mulching around the plants helps to conserve soil moisture and reduces the soil temperature.Harvesting Brussels sprouts are generally ready for harvest 90 to 180 days after planting when the heads are firm and green and have reached between 2.5 and 5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in diameter.The oldest sprouts are located at the bottom of the stalk and mature upwards.As sprouts are removed, it can be beneficial to remove the leaves which are beginning to yellow.Some people prefer to remove all of the leaves on the stalk to accelerate maturity and harvest in a manner similar to commercial sprout production.The stalks can be removed before the ground freezes over and stored indoors for further harvesting.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Brassica oleracea datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10102.

The buckwheat plant is a fast growing, spindly, broad leaf plant with small heart-shaped leaves and hollow stems. The plant produces many small white or pink flowers which, when pollinated, quickly produce seeds.The seeds are triangular in shape and change from light green in color, to red- brown.The seed consists of a true seed (groat) which is surrounded by a thick hull.Buckwheat plants can grow between 40 and 120 cm (15.7-47.2 in) in height and survive for just one growing season.Buckwheat may also be referred to as qiaomei or ogal and was likely first domesticated from a wild ancestor in China.Buckwheat flowering Buckwheat flower Buckwheat field in Japan Uses Buckwheat can be used in the production of many foods in place of wheat e.g., pancakes, cakes and biscuits.It is also commonly used in breakfast cereals or it may also be blended into flour.The grain may also be used as fodder for animals.
Buckwheat is an excellent cover crop, taking only 4â€“5 weeks from seed to flower and can protect against soil erosion and invasion by weeds. Buckwheat Content Propagation Basic requirements Buckwheat grows optimally in temperate or sub-tropical climates where the temperatures are between 15â€“25Â°C but it may also be grown successfully in more tropical climates at higher elevation.Buckwheat will be killed by frost.In addition, the plants require a period of dry weather for harvest.Buckwheat can be grown in poor soils but will produce optimally in well-draining loamy soil.The plants will tolerate a wide pH range from 4.5 down to 7.0.It is a short-season crop and therefore does well when planted in the fall, stimulated by shorter day length.Sowing Buckwheat is grown by direct seeding and the seedbed should be properly prepared in advance of sowing.The soil should be fine but firm and dug to a depth of approximately 5 cm (2.0 cm) to aid in seedling emergence.
Commercial fields are sown by mechanical drilling in rows spaced approximately 30 cm (12 in) apart but can simply be sown simply by broadcasting in the home garden. Seed should be scattered at a rate of about one pound of seed per 500 square feet of soil.General care and maintenance Buckwheat can be grown in nutrient poor soils and it does not require the addition of fertilizer.If growing buckwheat as a cover crop it should be mowed down within 2 weeks of flowering to prevent the plants setting seed.The plant debris can be turned under the soil to decompose as green manure.Allow a few weeks between mowing and planting any new crops to allow the plant matter to decompose.References BjÃ¶rkman, T.(2010).Buckwheat Production: Planting.Cornell University Cooperative Extension.Agronomy Fact Sheet Series.Fact Sheet 50.Available at: http://nmsp.cals.cornell.edu/publications/factsheets/factsheet50.pdf.[Accessed 07 November 14].Paid subscription required .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.

Whether cooked, fermented, or used in beauty treatments, cabbage offers a wealth of benefits for health and wellness. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.In cooking, cabbages can be boiled, steamed, roasted, or sautÃ©ed, and are a popular ingredient in soups, stews, stir-fries, salads, and slaws.Fermented cabbages, such as sauerkraut, are a traditional and nutritious food, while cabbage juice may be used topically for skin health.Additionally, cabbages can be used as animal feed or for decorative purposes.Climatic, soil, and water conditions Cabbage is a cool-season crop that requires specific climatic, soil, and water conditions to grow successfully, as described below.Climatic Conditions : The crop prefers cool and moist conditions, with an average temperature range of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 18 degrees Celsius).
Temperatures above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) can cause the cabbage heads to bolt, which means they will prematurely form seed stalks instead of edible heads. Cabbage requires at least six hours of sunlight per day and does well in regions with a long growing season.Soil Conditions : Cabbage grows well in well-drained soils that are rich in organic matter.The soil should be loose, fertile, and have a pH between 6.0 and 6.8.The soil should be well-aerated and have a good water-holding capacity, Cabbage (red, white, Savoy) Content allowing water to infiltrate and drain easily.Adding compost or other organic matter to the soil before planting can help improve its structure and fertility.Water Conditions : The crop requires regular watering, especially during the early stages of growth.The optimal amount of water for cabbages is around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per week, either from rainfall or irrigation.
Soil moisture should be monitored closely to prevent either underwatering or overwatering, as either condition can cause problems with growth, yield, and disease susceptibility. Description Crops details Scientific name: Brassica oleracea Order, family, and genus: Brassicales, Brassicaceae, and Brassica.Local names: Kabichi (Swahili) Other names: Spanish: col, French: chou, German: Kohl, Italian: cavolo, Portuguese: couve, Mandarin Chinese: ç™½è​œ (bÃ¡i cÃ i), Japanese: ã‚​ã ƒ £ã ƒ ™ General Information Cabbage is a leafy vegetable with a round, compact head or "heart" made up of many layers of thick, sturdy leaves that grow in a tightly packed formation.The outer leaves are usually a darker green, while the inner leaves are lighter in color.The leaves have a smooth, slightly waxy texture and a slightly bitter taste.The densely leafed heads can range in size from 0.5 to 3.6 kg (1â€“8 lb) depending on variety.
Cabbage typically ranges in size from small to large, with smaller heads being more tender and sweeter. The vegetable can also come in different colors, including green, purple, and white, depending on the variety.When cooked, cabbage softens and becomes more tender, but it still retains its distinctive taste and texture.Cabbage has its roots in the Mediterranean region, but today it is grown in many other countries as well.China is currently the largest producer of cabbage, accounting for more than half of the world's production.Other top producers include India, Russia, and South Korea.Some of the top cabbage-producing countries in Africa include Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.In Ethiopia, cabbage is one of the most widely grown vegetables and is an important crop for small-scale farmers.In Tanzania, the crop is grown in the highlands and is an important source of income for farmers.
Kenya is also a major producer, with the crop being grown in areas such as Kiambu and Nyandarua counties. In South Africa, cabbage is grown in several regions, including Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Western Cape.Fields of cabbage Red cabbage Cabbage heads ready for harvest Close-up of cabbage foliage Field of cabbages Cabbage leaves Cabbage head ready for harvest Cabbage leaves Cabbage Varieties There are many different varieties of cabbage.The main varieties are white and red cabbage (B rassica oleracea var.capitata ) and savoy cabbage ( Brassica oleracea var.Sabauda ).Red cabbage has a deep purple-red color and a slightly sweeter flavor than green cabbage, while savoy has crinkly, curly leaves that are a darker shade of green than green cabbage.There are many other different varieties of cabbage, each with its own unique characteristics: Green cabbage : This variety has a tight head of crisp, green leaves.
Red cabbage : This variety has a deep purple-red color and a slightly sweeter flavor than green cabbage. Napa cabbage : Also known as Chinese cabbage, this variety has long, oblong leaves and a milder flavor than other types of cabbage.Bok choy : A type of Chinese cabbage with white stalks and dark green leaves, often used in stir-fries.Brussels sprouts : While technically not a variety of cabbage, Brussels sprouts are a close relative.They grow on a stalk and have small, round heads of tightly packed leaves.Conehead cabbage : This variety has a pointed head and pale green leaves.January King cabbage : This variety has a greenish-blue color and is known for its sweet and nutty flavor.Pointed cabbage : This variety has a pointed head and is similar in flavor to green cabbage.Stonehead cabbage : This variety has a small, tight head and is very dense and heavy.
Planting procedure To maximize yield and produce healthy and flavorful cabbages, the following steps should be followed when planting cabbages. Soil preparation : Cabbage prefers well-draining soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 6.8.Before planting, the soil should be tilled and amended with biochar, compost, or other organic matter to improve soil structure and fertility.Seed selection : Choose high-quality cabbage seeds from a reputable seed supplier.There are many different varieties of cabbage, each with different growing requirements and mature sizes.Select a variety that suits your growing conditions and preferences.Seed starting : Cabbage seeds can be started indoors or directly sown in the garden.If starting indoors, sow the seeds in a seed tray or container with a good-quality seed-starting mix.Keep the soil consistently moist and maintain a temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius).Seeds typically germinate within 7 to 10 days.
Transplanting : When the seedlings have grown to about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) tall, they can be transplanted into the garden. Cabbage should be planted at a spacing of 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters) apart, with rows spaced 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 centimeters) apart.Planting : Plant the seedlings in a hole slightly deeper than their root ball and gently firm the soil around them.Water the soil well after planting to help settle it.Maintenance : Cabbage requires consistent moisture, so water regularly to prevent the soil from drying out.Fertilize the plants every two weeks with a balanced fertilizer high in nitrogen.Cabbage plants are also prone to pests and diseases, so monitor the plants regularly for signs of damage or stress and take appropriate measures to control any issues.Cabbages can be started in a cold frame and transplanted Cabbage seedlings Harvesting Harvesting cabbages is an important task in vegetable farming.
Cabbage is typically grown for its dense, leafy heads that are used in a variety of culinary dishes. When it's time to harvest, farmers carefully inspect each head of cabbage to determine if it's ready to be picked.They look for the firmness and tightness of the head as well as the size and color of the leaves.Once a cabbage head is deemed ready for harvest, the farmer uses a sharp knife to cut it off at the base.It's important to be careful during this process to avoid damaging the plant or other nearby cabbages.After harvesting, the cabbages are washed and stored in a cool, dry place until they're ready to be sold or used.Overall, harvesting cabbages requires attention to detail and a steady hand, but the end result is a delicious and nutritious vegetable that can be enjoyed in a variety of dishes.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Brassica oleracea datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10102.[Accessed 13 March 23].Paid subscription required.

Management Cabbage does not have high levels of resistance to blackleg and fungicides use is uneconomical; use disease free seed or treat with hot water to remove fungus prior to planting; remove and destroy crop debris after harvest or plow deeply into soil.
Category : Fungal, Oomycete Downy mildew Peronospora parasitica Downy mildew symptoms on cabbage leaf Downy mildew symptoms on cabbage leaf Symptoms Irregular yellow patches on leaves which turn light brown in color; fluffy gray growth on the undersides of the leaves Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favored by cool, moist conditions Management Remove all crop debris after harvest; rotate with non-brassicas; application of appropriate fungicides may be required if symptoms of disease are present Category : Viral Ring spot Mycosphaerella brassicicola Symptoms Small, purple spots surrounded by a ring of water-soaked tissue on leaves which mature to brown spots with olive green borders 1-2 cm across; spots may develop numerous fruiting bodies which give them a black appearance or develop a concentric pattern; heavily infected leaves may dry up and curl inwards Cause Fungus Comments Ring spot requires cool, moist conditions to survive; disease symptoms typically develop in the fall and the peak of the infection occurs in winter Management Refrain from planting in areas known to have had disease previously; rotate crop to non-brassicas; sanitize tools and equipment regularly; apply appropriate fungicide if disease is identified in crop Category : Other Slugs & snails (Gray garden slug, Spotted garden slug, Brown garden snail, European garden snail , etc.) Decoratus reticulatum Limax maximus Helix aspersa Cornu aspersum European brown snail Gray garden slug Symptoms Irregularly shaped holes in leaves and stems; flowers and fruit may also be damaged if present; if infestation is severe, leaves may be shredded; slime trails present on rocks, walkways, soil and plant foliage; several slug and snail species are common garden pests; slugs are dark gray to black in color and can range in size from 2.5 to 10 cm (1-4 in); garden snails are generally smaller and possess a rounded or spiral shell Cause Mollusc Comments Slugs and snails prefer moist, shaded habitats and will shelter in weeds or organic trash; adults may deposit eggs in the soil throughout the season; damage to plants can be extensive Management Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs and snails; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g.
Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers Pests Category : Insects Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) larvae on soybean leaf Young larvae Beet armyworm adult Beet armyworm eggs covered in white hairs Larva of beet armyworm Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year.
Management Organic methods of controlling the beet armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae. Cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicaea Lady beetles feeding on aphids Dense colony Adult aphid Heavy infestation of cabbage leaves Heavily infested leaf Cabbage aphid adult Aphid colony Multiple life stage Cabbage aphid colony on a cabbage leaf Symptoms Large populations can cause stunted growth or even plant death; insects may be visible on the plant leaves and are small, grey-green in color and soft bodied and are covered with a white waxy coating; prefer to feed deep down in cabbage head and may be obscured by the leaves.Cause Insect Comments Cabbage aphids feed only on cruciferous plants but may survive on related weed species.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper feeding on cabbage leaf Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range Management Management may be needed after cabbage heading; biological controls such as spraying with Bacillus thuringiensis can be effective at controlling looper numbers; application of appropriate insecticide after heading also controls looper populations; selective insecticides help to protect populations of natural enemies on crop Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm feeding on plant stem Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Cutworm larva severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insect Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella Diamondback moth pupae Cabbage damaged by Diamondback moth larvae Larva feeding on cabbage leaf Symptoms Young larvae feed between upper and lower leaf surface and may be visible when they emerge from small holes on the underside of the leaf; older larvae leave large, irregularly shaped shotholes on leaf undersides, leaving the upper surface intact; larvae may drop from the plant on silk threads if the leaf is disturbed; larvae are small (1 cm/0.3 in) and tapered at both ends; larvae have to prolegs at the rear end that are arranged in a distinctive V-shape Cause Insect Comments Larvae take between 10 and 14 days to mature and spin a loose, gauze-like cocoon on leaves or stems to pupate Management Larvae can be controlled organically by applications of Bacillus thurengiensis or Entrust; application of appropriate chemical insecticide is only necessary if larvae are damaging the growing tips of the plants Flea beetle Phyllotreta spp.
Crucifer flea beetles and damage on cabbage leaf Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insect Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Large cabbage white (Cabbageworm) Pieres rapae Cabbage damaged by cabbageworm Cabbageworm and frass on a cabbage leaf Symptoms Large ragged holes in leaves or bored into head; green-brown frass (insect feces) on leaves; caterpillar is green in color and hairy, with a velvet-like appearance; may have faint yellow to orange stripes down back; slow-moving compared with other caterpillars Cause Insect Comments Butterfly larvae cause damage by feeding on plants; can be distinguished from other caterpillars by its sluggish movement; in large numbers larvae can cause extensive damage very quickly Management Plant can tolerate quite a lot of damage from caterpillars between transplanting and heading; hand pick caterpillars from plants and destroy; scrape eggs from leaves prior to hatching; apply appropriate insecticide if infestation is very heavy Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Thrips damage to cabbage head Onion thrips on cabbage Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Cause Insect Comments Transmit several viruses including Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.
Symptoms Galls on roots which can be up to 3.3 cm (1 in) in diameter but are usually smaller; reduction in plant vigor; yellowing plants which wilt in hot weather Cause Nematode Comments Galls can appear as quickly as a month prior to planting; nematodes prefer sandy soils and damage in areas of field or garden with this type of soil is most likely Management Plant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil ;check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes; solarizing soil can reduce nematode populations in the soil and levels of inoculum of many other pathogens Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Cantaloupe, Cucumis melo , is a vining plant in the family Cucurbitaceae, grown for its large, sweet fruit of the same name.
Cantaloupe vines are trailing and are slightly hairy with simple oval leaves arranged alternately on the stem. The plant produces small yellow flowers which are 1.2â€“3.0 cm (0.5â€“1.2 in) in diameter and large oval to round fruit with green to orange flesh.Melon is an annual plant and a vine can grow up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in length.Cantaloupe may be referred to as muskmelon or melon and likely originate from East and Northeast Africa.Ripe cantaloupe ready for harvest Cantaloupe flowers Cantaloupe foliage and blossom Cantaloupe vines Cantaloupe Close-up of cantaloupe leaf Uses Melon is primarily consumed as a fresh fruit.The pulp may be turned into a fresh beverage and the seeds can be roasted and eaten.The unripe fruit of some species are cooked as a vegetable.Cantaloupe Content Propagation Basic requirements Cantaloupe is a warm-season crop, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 28Â°C (65â€“82Â°F).
Melon will yield best if grown in a light, well- draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Cantaloupe should be planted in full sun and are heavy feeders and water users.They need to be provided with ample soil moisture and fertilized regularly.Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space.Sowing seeds Cantaloupe can be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season but in more Northern climates it should be sown indoors and transplanted.If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 18.4Â°C (65Â°F).Allow 90â€“120 cm (~3â€“4 ft) between seeds in a row and 150â€“180 cm (~5â€“6 ft) between rows.If transplanting, seeds should be sown approximately 3â€“4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted after the plants develop their first set of true leaves.
Seeds sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering as seeds are prone to rotting. Seeds should germinate in 3â€“10 days depending on the soil temperature.Transplanting Cantaloupe seedlings should be transplanted when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 18.4Â°C (65Â°F).Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting.Beginning approximately 7â€“10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264).The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth.When transplanting seedlings, allow 90â€“120 cm (~3â€“4 ft) between plants and 150â€“180 cm (~5â€“6 ft) between rows.
Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist. General care and maintenance Cantaloupe vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow.Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence to save space.Cantaloupe plants also require a regular supply of water while growing, blooming and setting fruit and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water.Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene mulch has the advantage of warming the soil.Harvesting Cantaloupes are ready to be harvested when the the surface becomes netted and the color underneath turns from green to yellow.When the melon is ready to picked the stem will come away easily from the fruit.Cantaloupe seedling with first set of true leaves References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2011).Cucumis melo datasheet.

Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others bronzed cutworm (Nephelodes minians) larvae Colorful larva of the variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia) variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia) Cutworm bronzed cutworm (Nephelodes minians) adult Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed. Cause Insect Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato.
Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically. Flea beetles Epitrix spp.
flea beetles (Epitrix spp.) Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance. Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied.

Cardamom is a clumping plant with between 10 and 20 leafy shoots arising from the rhizome.The shoots are actually pseudostems composed of overlapping leaf sheaths.There are several additional flowering shoots.The leaves are lanceolate and dark green in color.The plant produces flowers on a long drooping pannicle and a capsule- like fruit which is triangular in cross section and initially pale green or yellow in color but dries to brown.The fruit contains 15â€“20 small aromatic seeds.Cardamom can reach a height of 5 m (16.4 ft) and has an economic lifespan of 10-15 years.
Cardamom may also be referred to as green cardamom, black cardamom, brown cardamom, red cardamom or white cardamom and originates from southern India and Sri Lanka. Cardamom pods Cardamom pods Cardamom pods Cardamom flower Cardamom plant Cardamom plants Uses The cardamom fruit or seeds are used dried as a culinary spice.The seeds are used whole or ground.Cardamom may Cardamom Content also be used as a flavoring in drinks, baked goods and confection.Propagation Basic requirements Cardamom originates from mountainous forests and can be grown in a variety of soils ranging from forest loam to quartz gravels.It can be grown in the home garden in areas with tropical climates and elsewhere can be grown as a container plant and moved indoors when the temperature drops in the Fall.The optimum annual mean temperature for the growth of the plant is 22Â°C (71.6Â°F) and the plant will not grow below 17Â°C (62.6Â°F).
As a consequence of their forest origins, cardamom plants thrive in shaded areas with indirect sunlight. Propagation Cardamom seeds can be collected from the mature capsules (pods) by gently pressing the capsules until they pop open.The seeds should be left to dry for a couple of days before planting in a container or outdoors in a prepared bed.For large scale production, they are commonly sown in nursery beds and transplanted to the field when they are 1â€“2 years old.Propagation from rhizomes is achieved by dividing the rhizome of plants that have at least three shoots.Plants are usually spaced 1.5â€“3 m (5â€“10 ft) apart allowing a further 1.5â€“3 m (5â€“10 ft) between rows.References Anandaraj, M.& Sudharsham, M.R.(2010).Cardomom, ginger and turmeric.In Verheye, W.H.(ed) Soils, Plant Growth and Crop Production.Eolss Publishers Company Limited.Chapter available at: http://www.eolss.net/Sample- Chapters/C10/E1-05A-49-00.pdf.

The carrot plant produces a rosette of 8â€“12 leaves above ground and a fleshy conical taproot below ground. The plant produces small (2 mm) flowers which are white, red or purple in color.The root can grow to between 5 and 50 cm (2.0â€“20 in) long and reach 5 cm (2.0 in) in diameter.The foliage of the plant can reach a height of 150 cm (59.1 in) when in flower.The carrot plant can be annual or biennial and may also be referred to as wild carrot.The plant is believed to have originated in Europe or the Western Mediterranean.Carrot flowers Carrot foliage Carrot taproot emerging from the soil Freshly harvested carrots Carrot foliage Harvested carrots Uses Carrot roots are eaten as a vegetable and can be consumed fresh or cooked.Carrot juice is consumed as a beverage.The leaves of the plant can be used as feed for animals.
Carrot Content Propagation Basic requirements Carrots are cool-season crops which can be planted in early Spring and left in the ground all summer for harvest in the fall. Carrots grow best in a well-draining, loose, sandy soil which is free of large rocks and has a pH between 5.5 and 7.0.They require full sun for optimum development but will tolerate some very light shade.The optimum temperature for their growth is between 16 and 24Â°C (61â€“74Â°F).Carrot seedlings are very sensitive to extremes of temperature, very hot weather may kill the plant whereas temperatures below 10Â°C (50Â°F) tend to cause the development of longer, paler roots.The plants also require plenty moisture and organic matter.Carrots do very well in raised beds and can also be grown in containers.Sowing seeds Carrot is usually direct seeded and should be planted 3â€“5 weeks before the least frost date in your area.
Soil should be prepared prior to planting by removing rocks and breaking up any hard lumps of soil down to a depth of at least 30 cm (12 in). It is also beneficial to work some compost into the soil prior to planting.Avoid using fresh manure as it can cause forking of the roots.Sow seeds 6 mm (0.25 in) deep, leaving 5 cm (2 in) between seeds and approximately 30 cm (1 ft) apart.When seedlings reach 2.5 cm (1 in) in height, thin them to a final spacing of 7.5 cm (3 in) between plants by snipping with scissors - this avoids damaging plant roots.General care and maintenance Carrots benefit from a plentiful moisture supply and should be provided with 2.5 cm (1 in) of water each week.Mulching around the plants helps to conserve moisture and reduce weeds.Any weeds growing around the plants should be carefully removed.The plants should be fertilized 5â€“6 weeks after the seeds are sown.
Harvesting Carrots are generally ready to harvest after around 2â€“3 months when the roots have reached 1.3 cm (0.5 in) in diameter. Allowing the carrots to stay in the ground for at least one frost makes them sweeter but care should be taken to harvest before the ground freezes or to cover the plants to prevent freezing.Carrots are harvested by gently digging around the plant to expose the top of the root and gently, but firmly pulling the root from the soil by grasping the top of the carrot just above the root.Carrot tops should be twisted off and the roots washed prior to refrigeration in airtight bags.Carrots may also be stored in moist sand to keep them fresh prior to use.Gently pull the carrot from the soil by grasping the top at the base Dig around the plant to expose the root References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Daucus carota datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/18018.[Accessed 10 November 14].Paid subscription required .Davis, R.M.& Raid, R.

lesions may coalesce causing leaves to yellow and die; lesions may be present on petioles Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favored by wet foliage and warm weather; rain and fog enhance the development of the disease; fungus survives in soil on crop debris but is killed when the debris decomposes Management Disease can be difficult to control in wet, warm conditions; apply appropriate fungicides when first symptoms appear or as a protective measure in humid areas; treat seeds with fungicide or hot water prior to planting; apply gibberellic acid to carrot foliage to promote upright growth and promote air circulation through canopy Black rot Alternaria radicina Symptoms Damping-off of seedlings; root and crown necrosis; blighted foliage; lower portion of petioles black and necrotic; black ring around petiole attachment black, sunken lesions on taproot Cause Fungi Comments Disease is spread through infected seed and can survive in soil for up to 8 years Management Black rot is difficult to control and can survive in the soil for long periods of time: practice long crop rotations ; plow crop residue into soil immediately after harvest; plant resistant varieties; plant only pathogen-free seed; treat seeds with hot water prior to planting Cercospora leaf blight Cercospora carotae Necrotic flecks on carrot foliage Symptoms Small, necrotic flecks on leaves which develop a chlorotic halo and expand into tan brown necrotic spots; lesions coalesce and cause leaves to wither, curl and die Cause Fungus Comments Disease can be introduced through infested seed and spread by wind or water splash; symptoms usually occur on younger foliage first Management Plant only pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; plow crop debris into soil ofter harvest; apply appropriate fungicide sprays Cottony rot (Sclerotinia rot) Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Carrot field infected with Sclerotinia Carrot covered in white mold caused by Sclerotinia infection Symptoms Small, water-soaked, soft lesions on crown and roots; white fluffy fungal growth all over affected tissues; soft and decaying tissue developing Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for up to 10 years; disease emergence is favored by soils that are held close to saturation for periods in excess of 2 weeks Management Cultural practices play an important role in the control of cottony rot as there are no resistand carrot varieties: in carrot fields, the use of drip irrigation 5-8 cm below the soil surface can provide good control; deep plowing of soil and trimming back carrot foliage to promote air circulation can also be useful; fungicides may be warranted in periods of extended cool, damp weather Downy mildew Peronospora umbellifarum Symptoms Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; white fluffy growth on underside of leaves; lesions become darker as the mature Cause Fungus Comments Disease affects young, tender leaves; disease emergence and spread is favored by prolonged leaf wetness Management Plant pathogen-free seed; do not overcrowd plants; rotate crops with non-umbelliferous varieties Powdery mildew Erisyphe heraclei Symptoms Powdery growth on leaves, petioles flowers stalks and bracts; leaves becoming chlorotic; severe infections can cause flowers to become distorted Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can spread long distances in air; disease emergence is favored by high humidity and moderate temperatures; infection is most severe in shaded areas Management Plant tolerant varieties; avoid excess fertilization; protective fungicide applications provide adequate protection; sulfur application can be used in infection occurs early in season Category : Bacterial Bacterial leaf blight Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms Small, angular, yellow spots on leaves which expand into irregularly shaped, brown, water-soaked lesions with a yellow halo; centers of lesions dry out, become brittle; leaves may become curled or distorted; flower stalks may develop elongated lesions that exude a bacterial ooze; infected umbels may be blighted Cause Bacterium Comments Bacteria can be spread by splashing irrigation water or rain or on contaminated equipment Management Plant pathogen-free seed; avoid using sprinkler irrigation; apply appropriate bactericides if available Soft rot Erwinia carotovora Erwinia chrysanthemi Pseudomonas marginalis Symptoms Sunken dull orange lesions on taproot which causes tissue to collapse and become soft Cause Bacteria Comments Bacteria thrive in oxygen depleted plant tissue; disease emergence requires long periods of water saturated soil; bacteria enter plants through wounds Management Control relies on the avoidance of conditions conducive to bacterial infection: plant carrots in well-draining soils; allow plants to dry before irrigating again; avoid wounding plants during harvest to prevent pst harvest development of disease; disinfect all equipment regularly Category : Oomycete Cavity spot Pythium spp.
Symptoms Sunken, elliptical, gray lesions across the root; outer layer of root ruptures and develops dark, elongated lesions; small vertical cracks may form on the cavities Cause Fungi Comments Fungi can persist in soil for several years and disease outbreaks are associated with wet soils; flooded soil increases the number of cavities formed Management Some cultural practices can control the disease: avoid planting in fields/areas known to previously had carrot spot; do not over-fertilize plants; application(s) of appropriate fungicide can provide adequate control Category : Fungal, Oomycete Damping-off Pythium spp.
Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Soft, rotting seeds which fail to germinate; rapid death of seedling prior to emergence from soil; collpase of seedlings after they have emerged from the soil caused by water-soaked reddish lesions girdling the stem at the soil line Cause Fungi Comments Damping-off diseases favor conditions which slow seed germination; fungi can be spread in water, contaminated soil or on equipment Management Management Avoid planting carrots in poorly draining, cool, wet soil; planting in raised beds will help with soil drainage; plant high quality seed that germinates quickly; treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting to eliminate fungal pathogens Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Willow-carrot aphid) Cavariella aegopodii Willow-carrot aphid colony Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; willow-carrot aphid will also attack parnip, parsley and celery Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Carrot rust fly Psila rosae Damage to carrot surface caused by larvae tunneling Carrot rust fly Symptoms Surface scarring of taproot caused by tunnels; tunnels are filled with a rust colored mush; adult insect is a small, dark colored fly; larvae are white maggots approximately 1 cm (0.3 in) long Cause Insect Comments Carrot rust fly also attacks parsnip, celery and other Umbelliferous crops which will also need to be protected if carrot rust fly is a problem Management Use of row covers will help to protect plants from damage but they must be installed before adult fly lays eggs on plants; harvest carrots in blocks; do not leave any carrots in the ground over winter to reduce overwintering sites Carrot weevil Listronotus oregonensis Close-up of weevil damage Adult carrot weevil Carrot weevil damage Damage to carrots and weevil larvae Carrot weevil damage Carrot damaged by carrot weevil Symptoms Irregular dark grooves in zig-zag pattern on roots; leaves of plant may yellow; adult insect is a dark colored beetle; larvae are white to pinkish white C-shaped grubs with a yellow-brown head Cause Insect Comments Adult weevils overwinter in crop debris remaining in the ground; larvae feed for approximately 2 weeks before pupating in the soil; insect undergoes several generations each year Management Remove all debris from Umbelliferous crops (e.g.

The cashew tree has a branching main trunk and characteristic domed crown. The thin foliage of the tree is limited to the ends of the branches and is made up of oval-oblong leathery, shiny dark green leaves.The leaves are smooth with pronounced veins and midrib and possess petioles that are swollen at their base.The tree produces numerous pinkish-white flowers on drooping panicles and a kidney-shaped true fruit (nut) which is approximately 3 cm (1.2 in) long with a grey-brown shell and develops from a fleshy accessory fruit, sometimes referred to as the 'cashew apple'.The cashew apple is pear-shaped and red to yellow.Cashew trees can reach a height of 12 m (39.4 ft) and have an economic lifespan of 25 years after which time they are replaced in commercial plantations.Cashew originates from Brazil.
The Portuguese introduced cashew to Mozambique in the 16th century where it flourished, forming extensive forests; eventually, it also became dispersed in East Africa along the coastal plains of Kenya and Tanzania. Cashew Varieties in Kenya Recommended varieties of cashew nuts by KALRO are A75/83, A100, A81, and A82.Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management Cashew trees are usually grown at altitudes of between 0-500 m above sea level (asl) but can grow up to 1000 m asl.They can be very drought resistant provided their roots penetrate deeply into the soil and draw water from the subsoil.For mature trees 500 mm of rainfall per year is adequate, but seedlings should be watered until properly established.If rainfall is below 900 mm per year plant at the widest spacing indicated.Cashew nut trees tolerate a wide range of soils provided they are deep and well-drained.They can grow quite well on infertile soils but do not do well on coral outcrops at the coast.
Uses The kernels or nuts have a high nutritional as well as commercial value and are used for human consumption either raw or roasted. The cashew nut apple is rich in Vitamin C (about 5 times higher than the orange) and is used for the production of juice, wines, spirits, jam, pickles, and chutneys.The liquid of the shell is used for brake linings, heatproof and waterproof paints, and protective varnishes.Cashew nut wood is of poor quality but can be used as firewood if mixed with other types of wood.Planting Procedure Cashew nuts should be planted at the beginning of the rainy season.In the Coastal lowlands, the best time for planting is between April to June.Cashew nuts are usually propagated through seed or grafted seedlings.In propagation by direct seeding 3 seeds are planted in the planting hole and two months after germination the weak seedlings are uprooted leaving the strong ones to grow.
The holes should be 60 cm by 60cm so that they can be able to collect water during the rainy season which will be used during the dry season. Cashew trees are generally planted with a spacing of 7.5 m X 7.5 m (175 plants/ ha) or 8 m X 8 m (156 plants/ ha) is recommended.High-density planting of cashew at a closer spacing of 4 m X 4 m (625 plants/ ha) in the beginning and thinning out in stages to maintain a final spacing of 8 m X 8 m in the tenth year is also recommended.Proper seed selection from healthy, high-yielding trees is important, and it can be done by sorting out seeds by the water density method: Place the seeds in a bucket of seawater (100 g salt per 5 liters of water) and select the seeds that sink for planting.Those that float have poor germination and growth potential.Sundry seeds for planting for several weeks to prevent mold and rotting.Do not plant seeds that are more than one year old.Intercropping can be done before the canopies close.
Most annual crops can be used apart from cotton and sweet potatoes, which are host plants for Helopeltis bugs, major pests of cashew. Do not interplant young trees with pasture because of the high competition for water during the dry season.Planting using grafted seedlings Propagation through grafting starts by raising rootstock propagated from local cashew nut varieties.The first step is a visual selection of seeds to remove diseased or deformed seeds.The selected seeds are taken through a flotation test in water.Seeds that sink are planted in pre-germination beds.The pre-germinated seeds are transplanted into potting bags when the radicals (tap root) are 2.5 â€“3cm after 7-10 days.The recommended soil media for cashew nut seedlings is in the ratio of 2:1:150 where: 2 is two buckets of soil, 1 is one bucket of well-decomposed farmyard manure, and 150gms of DAP.The seedlings are transplanted in potting bags (6" x 9").
This composition can sustain the plant for an average of three months after transplanting the pre-germinated seeds in them. Seedlings are ready for grafting when they attain more than two functional leaves and the cotyledons are still attached to the young stem.Grafting is done 3-4 weeks after transplanting into potting bags.Scions for grafting are harvested from select mother plants.The following procedure for grafting is recommended: a.Cut and remove the actively growing part of the rootstock, leaving two functional leaves.b.Vertically cut down the stock between the two leaves to a depth of 2.5 â€“ 3.0cm.c.Make a wedge cut of the scion of a similar length of 2.5-3.0 cm and sharpen it.d.Insert the scion into the rootstock and tie them together.e.Cover the scion and the rootstock by wrapping them with grafting tape.f.Wait for 2-3 weeks and unwrap the scion.Husbandry Husbandry No fertilizer is required, but well-rotted manure at planting is beneficial.
The area around the tree should be 1 Â½ times the size of the canopy and should be kept clean of weeds for the first 2 years to avoid competition. If planted on a slope the tree should have a U-shaped mound of soil below it to collect rainwater for improved growth.Seeds germinate within 2-4 weeks.Thin after 3-4 months leaving only the strongest plant at each site.Mulching with black polythene is beneficial to increase the growth and yield of cashew.However, locally available materials like green or dry grass or weeds can be utilized for mulching the basins.Small pebbles or stones can also be used for mulching the basin.Plastic or stone mulch does not improve soil health but ensures better moisture retention in the soil and also prevents the attack of soil-borne insects and pests.The topsoil and sub-soil are kept separately and allowed to wither under the sun.It helps in the migration of termites and ants(this is in the planting process).
Weeding with light digging should preferably be done before the end of the rainy season. Hoeing, cutting the weeds off underground is more effective than slashing.Cashew plants start bearing after three years of planting and reach full bearing during the tenth year and continue giving remunerative yields for another 20 years(so they can yield up to 45 years after being planted).Protect seedlings from monkeys, rodents, and bucks by placing wire cages or thorns around the seedlings.Support plants with a stick and trim off side shoots up to 60-90 cm from ground level.When trees are mature, prune dead wood or any borer-damaged or intergrowing branches to give the canopy air and light.Harvesting and Postharvest Handling Cashew nuts planted using seeds begin bearing 3 to 4 years after transplanting the seedlings.The nuts should be harvested as soon as possible, especially under wet conditions, and should be dried before storage.
Grafted seedlings begin bearing within 2 years of transplanting. Depending on the age and maturity of the plant, a tree yields between 10 to 100 kilograms of unshelled nuts per year.One hectare can thus produce between 2,000 to 5,000 kilograms of unshelled nuts per year.Although trees are produced for 40 to 50 years, commercial harvesting is for 35 years.The cashew nuts do not mature at the same time.The duration of harvest extends from 45-75 days and the nuts should be collected daily during this period.November to May is the harvesting period, with the peak harvest period from November to January.The nuts are collected at weekly intervals from the farm during the harvesting season.During that period the land should be clean to facilitate the collection of cashew.To get good quality nuts, clear the area beneath the tree, collect fallen fruits, detach the nut from the apple, and dry the nuts under the sun for about 2 hours.
The nuts can be graded into Fair Average Quality (FAQ) and Under Grade (UG). FAQ are well-matured nuts and they should be full and well-dried (12% moisture content).The color should be grey or pale brown.They should neither be wrinkled nor spotted.UG are well-dried and mature nuts.They can be spotted but not wrinkled.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Anacardium occidentale datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/5064.[Accessed 10 November 14].Paid subscription required .Duke, J.A.(1983).Anacardium occidentale L.Handbook of Energy Crops.unpublished.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/anacardium_occidentale.html#Ecology.[Accessed 10 November 14]..Hammed, L.A., Anikwe, J.C.& Adedeji, A.R.(2008).Cashew nuts and production development in Nigeria.American- Eurasian Journal of Scientific Research: 3 (1): 54-61.Available at: http://www.idosi.org/aejsr/3(1)08/11.pdf.[Accessed 10 November 14].Free to access .

Uses Cassava root is eaten as a vegetable and is considered to beÂ toxic inÂ raw form which is why it must be cooked before being consumed. The root has a variety of applications, some of which include the production of flour, starch, or ethanol.Â CassavaÂ leaves can supply a good source of vitamins and protein which can also be consumed after cooking.Cassava hay is used as animal feed and it plays a roleÂ in theÂ production of adhesives, textiles, and cosmetics.Description Cassava, Manihot esculenta , is a perennial shrub in the family Euphorbiaceae grown primarily for its storage roots which are eaten as a vegetable.The cassava plant is a woody plant with erect stems and spirally arranged simple lobed leaves with petioles (leaf stems) up to 30 cm in length.The plant produces petal-less flowers on a raceme.The edible roots of the plant are usually cylindrical and tapered and are white, brown or reddish in color.
Cassava plants can reach 4 m in height and is usually harvested 9-12 months after planting. Cassava may also be referred to as Brazilian arrowroot, manioc, yuca or tapioca and the origins of the plant are unknown.The plant is not known to occur wild but may have first been cultivated in Brazil.Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics, after rice and maize.It is a major staple food in the developing world, providing a basic diet for over half a billion people.It is Cassava (manioc) Content one of the most drought-tolerant crops, capable of growing on marginal soils.Harvested cassava roots Researcher working in cassava field Cassava leaf Cassava plants Cassava leaves Cassava plants Propagation Basic requirements Cassava thrives in tropical and subtropical regions of the world as it requires warm temperatures for optimal growth.The plants require at least 8 months of warm weather, thriving in regions with warm, moist climates with regular rainfall.
Cassava can be grown in many types of soil, producing even in poor soil but but will be optimally productive in well-draining, sandy clay loam with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Cassava is drought resistant but will not tolerate water-logging.Root production is maximized when temperatures are between 25 and 32Â°C (77â€“90Â°F).Cassava should be planted in full sun and is very sensitive to shading, which leads to low yields.Cuttings Cassava is propagated from stem cuttings as the tubers do not produce buds.Stem cuttings should only be taken from plants which are free from disease, are at least 10 months old and havee borne tubers.The cuttings should be taken from hardened stems leaving at least 30 cm (11.8 in) of stem intact in the ground.The stem can be severed using a sharp knife, secateurs or saw and each cutting should have 1-2 nodes and be approximately 20 cm (7.9 in) long.
Presprouting It is a good idea to dip the stem cuttings in an appropriate fungicide prior to planting to help prevent the development of diseases. The cuttings can then either be planted directly into a nursery bed or presprouted in trays or polyethylene bags.To presprout the stems, plant in a cell tray or bag which is filled with good quality soil.Plant one stem in each cell or bag by pushing it into the soil in the direction in which it was growing on the mother plant (oldest part of stem first).The trays should be kept in partial shade until the stems begin to sprout.If planting stem cuttings in a nursery bed (best for cuttings taken from higher up the stems where the wood is not mature), select a site with good quality soil in partial shade and prepare a bed at least 1 m (3.3 ft) wide.The stems can be planted horizontally in a nursery bed and this encourages the growth of multiple stems.Space the cuttings 10 x 10 cm (4 x 4 in) grid.
Stem cutting should be watered immediately after planting and on a regular basis thereafter. Aim to keep the soil moist but not wet.Stems should begin to sprout 7-10 days after planting.Transplanting Plants propagated from stem cuttings are ready to be transplanted after approximately 4-6 weeks.Prepare the field for planting by cultivating the soil and removing weeds.Space transplants 75â€“100 cm (2.5â€“3.2 ft) apart in rows spaced 1â€“-5 m (3.2â€“16.4 ft) apart.Fertilize the plants as appropriate.Manure or poultry droppings can be used.Cultivate the soil to remove weeds and break up the soil around the plants.Harvesting Cassava is ready to harvest about a year after planting depending on the variety being grown.Some early maturing varieties may be ready to harvest in around nine months.In colder regions, cassava tubers can remain in the ground for up to 2 years before harvesting but can become fibrous so this is not recommended where cassava is being grown for consumption.
Cassava tubers are harvested by digging. The roots should be dug up carefully to prevent damage.Cassava plantation in the Democratic Republic of Congo Planting cassava stem cuttings Cutting cassava stems References Adekunle, A.A., Dixon, A., Ojurongbe, J, Ilona, P, Muthada, L & Adisa, S.Growing Cassava Commercially in Nigeria.Information and Communication Support for Agricultural Growth in Nigeria (ICS-Nigeria).Available at: http://www.cassavabiz.org/agroenterpr....[Accessed 10 November 14].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Manihot esculenta datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/17585 .[Accessed 05 November 14].Paid subscription required .James, B., Yaninek, J, Tumanteh, A., Maroya, N., Dixon, A., Salawu, R.& Kwarteng, J.(2000).Starting a Cassava Farm.IPM Field Guide for Extension Agents.International Institute for Tropical Agriculture.Available at: http://www.infonet- biovision.org/res/....[Accessed 10 November 14].Free to access .

It was first reported in 1930's in Tanzania and become endemic in later years. It is currently travelling from East Africa westwards and has been reported in the DRC.There is considerable concern that it will appear in the major West African growing regions, notably Nigeria.The virus is transmitted through whiteflies and stem cuttings.The origin of CBSD is suspected to have arisen from the viruses that are already present on the indigenous African flora.Virus structure and properties: The microscopic studies revealed that the virus is 650 nm long and earlier it was believe to be carlavirus.But further studies associate the virus to Ipomovirus.Cassva Brown Streak Disease is caused by two distinct species of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), belonging to the genus Ipomovirus of the family Potyviridae.
Economic loss: Cassava is an important stable crop in Africa and the continent produces an estimated 54% of the world's cassava production. As such the threat from CBSD seems inevitable due to its presence in many eastern African countries and its rate of transmission westwards to the major growing regions in Nigeria (which produced 30.8% of the world's supply).Though the economic loss from brown streak virus depends on region, cultivars and environment conditions, in general it is estimated up to 70% yield loss in susceptible variety is common with losses as high as 100% being observed in some regions.If the disease is unchecked it may cause 2 billion dollar in loss in Nigeria alone and lead to increase widespread poverty and malnutrition in West and Central Africa.Management Disease diagnosis: The first and foremost important aspect is to identify the disease correctly.Cassava brown streak disease varies in symptoms which made it difficult to identify in the field.
It makes further complicated if both cassava brown streak and cassava mosaic diseases occur together. There are few techniques like serological and molecular methods are used to identify the virus in laboratory but have their limitations.Planting materials: Use only healthy and disease free cuttings for planting.Resistant cultivars: Plant cassava varieties that are more tolerant of brown streak virus such as Garukunsubire and Seruruseke.Roguing and sanitation: Remove and destroy any plants which are symptomatic of the disease including alternative hosts.Early Harvesting of tubers: Harvest crop early to avoid severe losses due to necrosis of tubers.Follow proper plant quarantine practices to avoid spread of virus to new region.Control insect vector: Whiteflies can be controlled by encouraging beneficial insects in the field like spiders, ladybird beetles etc.Use yellow sticky traps to monitor infestation of whiteflies.Spraying insecticidal soaps under leaf surface to kill flies.
Cassava Mosaic Disease African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) Severe CMD symptoms on leaf in Chambezi, Tanzania Whiteflies on cassava leaf Cassava leaves showing typical mottling caused by ACMV Cassava farmer showing severe damage to cassava roots infected with CMD Severe CMD symptoms on cassava leaf in Namulonge, southern Uganda ACMV-infected cassava plant Field in Kwimba, Mwanza Region, Tanzania devastated by CMD in the space of one season Whitefly nymphs on cassava leaf Resistant cassava variety beside a traditional susceptible variety with symptoms of ACMV Symptoms Discolored pale green, yellow or white mottled leaves which may be distorted with a reduced size; in highly susceptible cassava cultivars plant growth may be stunted, resulting in poor root yield and low quality stem cuttings.
Note that infected plants can express a range of symptoms and the exact symptoms depend on the species of virus and the strain as well as the environmental conditions and and the sensitivity of the cassava host. 1.Patches of discolouration (chlorosis) in the leaves that vary from yellow to green.2.The leaves display size variation and are often severely distorted.3.Leaf blades sometimes fold depending on severity shrivel.Cause Virus Comments Disease is spread by infected cuttings and by whiteflies.The leaves are yellow, mottled and distorted.If leaves are yellow all over but are a normal size or there brown leaves that that does not indicate disease.Wild cassava (kisamvu cha mpira in Kiswahili) also hosts the disease.The disease was first observed in the late 19th Century in what is now Tanzania.It was not until work in 1938 that the disease transmission was confirmed to occur via grafting as well as vectored by the White fly.
Management Varieties of cassava resistant to the virus are available in many countries, most traditional varieties of cassava grown in Africa are susceptible to the virus, seek advice from an agricultural extension on suitable varieties for your region (see below). Do not plant cuttings from plants with symptoms of disease; inspect plants regularly for symptoms of disease and remove and destroy any showing symptoms.Infected plants should be uprooted ('rouged').Replace with disease resistant varieties such as 'Rwizihiza', 'Ndamirabana', 'Cyizere', 'Seruruseke', 'Mavoka', 'Garukunsubire' and 'Mbakungahaze'.There is no agrochemical agent or organic treatment for this disease.There are both control strategies for the whitefly vector.

botrytis , is an herbaceous annual or biennial vegetable plant in the family Brassicaceae grown for its edible head. The head is actually a mass of abortive flowers (flowers which are unable to produce fruit or seed as they possess only female reproductive organs; the male organs are either underdeveloped or totally lacking).Cauliflower plants are shallow rooted with a small, thickened stem.The ribbed leaves branch off the top of the stem and are light green in color.The plant can reach a height of 1â€“1.5 m (3.3â€“4.9 ft) and is most commonly grown as an annual, harvested between 60 and 100 days after planting.The origin of cauliflower has not been definitively determined but its ancestor, wild cabbage, is thought to have originated in ancient Asia Minor.Cauliflower leaves Cauliflower Close-up of cauliflower florets Harvested cauliflower heads Cauilflower head developing Cauliflower plant Uses Cauliflower is grown for consumption as a vegetable, either fresh or cooked.
May be processed for freezing or pickling. Cauliflower Content Propagation Basic requirements Cauliflower is a cool season crop and grows best in well draining, organic soil at a pH of 6.5 or above.A high amount of organic matter in the soil will help to hold moisture.The plant requires consistent cool temperatures to prevent â€˜buttoningâ€™ - the formation of several small heads instead of one large one.Cauliflower is less cold hardy than its relatives and it should be planted after the last frost as sub-freezing temperatures are likely to damage the plant.It is best grown as a Fall crop in cooler areas.Only mature plants will survive frost in the Fall.Transplants Cauliflower is most successfully grown from transplants started in the glasshouse or indoors.Peat pots work well for growing seedlings as damage to the roots during transplanting can be avoided.Plant seeds in a sterile seed starting mix to a depth of 0.6-1.3 cm (0.25-0.5 in) deep and keep moist.
Seedlings can be transplanted when they are approximately 6 weeks old after hardening. Plant spacing will greatly affect the final size of the cauliflower head and the plants should be spaced at least 46 cm (18 in) apart leaving approximately 75 cm (30 in) between rows.General care and maintenance Cauliflower requires consistent moisture during the growing season in order to produce large, tender heads.Do not let the soil dry out.The plants also require ample nitrogen and this should b applied as a side-dressing of fertilizer about half way through the growing season.Cauliflower heads can be discolored by sunlight and when the cauliflower head has reached 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) the plant requires 'blanching', a process that ensures that the head remains white.This is achieved by gathering the longest outer leaves together at the head and tying them with twine.
Remove the twine periodically to check on the progress of the head, check for pests and to allow the head to dry out after rain. Self blanching varieties are available which grow leaves which naturally cover the head.Harvesting Cauliflower heads are ready for harvest when the head reaches 15 to 20 cm in diameter (6-8 in), usually about 7 to 12 days after blanching begins.Harvest the head by cutting the main stem with a sharp knife, including some of the central leaves which will protect the head.The heads can quickly become overmature, leading to reduced quality.Be sure to harvest the heads while they are still firm, before individual florets can be distinguished.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Brassica oleracea datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10102.[Accessed 10 November 14].Paid subscription required .Delahaut, K.A.& Newenhouse, A.C.(1997).Growing Broccoli, Cauliflower, Cabbage and other Cole crops in Wisconsin.

cereals) for at least 3 years; control weeds; avoid dense growth by planting in adequately spaced rows; apply appropriate foliar fungicides White rust Albugo candida Symptoms White pustules on cotyledons, leaves, stems and/or flowers which coalesce to form large areas of infection; leaves may roll and thicken Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive for long periods of time in dry conditions; disease spread by wind Management Rotate crops; plant only disease-free seed; apply appropriate fungicide if disease becomes a problem Category : Viral Cauliflower mosaic Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) Symptoms Mosaic patterns on leaves; veinclearing and or veinbanding; stunted plant growth; reduced head size Cause Virus Comments Transmitted by various species of aphid including the cabbage aphid, and peach aphid Management Control cruciferous weeds which can act as a reservoir for the virus; control aphid populations on plants by applying an appropriate insecticide Ring spot Mycosphaerella brassicicola Symptoms Small, purple spots surrounded by a ring of water-soaked tissue on leaves which mature to brown spots with olive green borders 1-2 cm across; spots may develop numerous fruiting bodies which give them a black appearance or develop a concentric pattern; heavily infected leaves may dry up and curl inwards Cause Fungus Comments Ring spot requires cool, moist conditions to survive; disease symptoms typically develop in the fall and the peak of the infection occurs in winter Management Refrain from planting in areas known to have had disease previously; rotate crop to non-brassicas; sanitize tools and equipment regularly; apply appropriate fungicide if disease is identified in crop Category : Fungal, Oomycete Wirestem (Damping-off) Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Death of seedlings after germination; brown-red or black rot girdling stem; seedling may remain upright but stem is constricted and twisted (wirestem) Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence in seedlings favored by cool temperatures Management Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants that have been produced in sterilized soil; apply fungicide to seed to kill off any fungi; shallow plant seeds or delay planting until soil warms Pests Category : Insects Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Young larvae Beet armyworm eggs covered in white hairs Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling the beet armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicaea Cabbage aphid colony Symptoms Large populations can cause stunted growth or even plant death; insects may be visible on the plant leaves and are small, grey-green in color and soft bodied and are covered with a white waxy coating; prefer to feed deep down in cabbage head and may be obscured by the leaves Cause Insect Comments Cabbage aphids feed only on cruciferous plants but may survive on related weed species Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Cabbage looper can be identified by their characteristic "looping" movement in which they arch their body and bring the back portion of the body forward to meet the front Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; biological controls such as spraying with Bacillus thuringiensis can be effective at controlling looper numbers; application of appropriate insecticide also controls looper populations; selective insecticides help to protect populations of natural enemies on crop Cucumber beetles (Western spotted cucumber beetle) Diabrotica undecimpunctata Spotted cucumber beetle Symptoms Stunted seedlings; damaged leaves, stems and/or petioles Cause Insect Comments Beetles overwinter in soil and leaf litter Management Monitor new planting regularly for signs of beetle; apply appropriate insecticides Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm feeding on plant stem Cutworms larva severing plant stem Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insect Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella Larva feeding on cabbage leaf Diamondback moth pupae Symptoms Young larvae feed between upper and lower leaf surface and may be visible when they emerge from small holes on the underside of the leaf; older larvae leave large, irregularly shaped shotholes on leaf undersides, may leave the upper surface intact; larvae may drop from the plant on silk threads if the leaf is disturbed; larvae are small (1 cm/0.3 in) and tapered at both ends; larvae have to prolegs at the rear end that are arranged in a distinctive V-shape Cause Insect Comments Larvae take between 10 and 14 days to mature and spin a loose, gauze-like cocoon on leaves or stems to pupate Management Larvae can be controlled organically by applications of Bacillus thurengiensis or Entrust; application of appropriate chemical insecticide is only necessary if larvae are damaging the growing tips of the plants Flea beetles Phyllotreta cruciferae Crucifer flea beetles Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insects Comments Flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Large cabbage white (Cabbageworm) Pieres rapae Cabbage white catterpillar Symptoms Large ragged holes in leaves or bored into head; green-brown frass (insect feces) on leaves; caterpillar is green in color and hairy, with a velvet-like appearance; may have faint yellow to orange stripes down back; slow-moving compared with other caterpillars Cause Insect Comments Larvae cause damage by feeding on plants; can be distinguished from other caterpillars by its sluggish movement; in large numbers larvae can cause extensive damage very quickly Management Plant cHand-pick caterpillars from plants and destroy; scrape eggs from leaves prior to hatching; apply appropriate insecticide if infestation is very heavy Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.

The rhombic leaves of the celery plant grow in a rosette and are 3â€“6 cm (1.2â€“2.4 in) long and 2â€“4 cm (0.8â€“1.6 in) broad on a branched central stem which is highly ribbed. The plant produces creamy white flowers in dense umbels (an umbrella of short flower stalks) and produces broad oval seeds 1.5â€“2 mm (<0.1 in) long and wide.Celery is a biennial plant that is commonly grown as an annual and it can reach a height of about 1 m.Celery may also be referred to as celeriac which is the name given to the root and is believed to have originated in the Eastern Mediterranean.Celery root (celeriac) Celery root (celeriac) Harvested celery stalks Celery blossoms Celery plant Celery plant Uses Celery is eaten around the world as a vegetable.Both the taproot and leaves are often used.Temperate countries grow celery for its seeds, which are often mixed with salt to make celery salt for seasoning.
Celery Content Propagation Basic requirements Celery is a cool season vegetable which grows best in cool climates in well-draining, fertile soils with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8.. Celery plants grow optimally in cool, moist locations and will tolerate some shade but will not tolerate heat.The plants require constant moisture and can tolerate temperatures between 5 and 27Â°C (41â€“80.6Â°F) with the optimum for growth being between 15â€“21Â°C (59â€“69.8Â°F).If temperatures drop below 12.7Â°C (55Â°F) then the plants will benefit from protective coverings to prevent the plants from bolting (going to seed).Sowing seeds For best results celery should usually be started indoors or in a glasshouse and transplanted to the garden or field.Germination of celery seeds is slow and the seeds should be planted 10 to 12 weeks before the last Spring frost.Soaking seeds in warm water overnight prior to planting can increase germination success.
Plant seeds in seedling flats containing a good quality sterile seed starting mix by lately sprinkling a pinch of seeds across the soil surface and covering with a thin layer of starting mix or vermiculite. Place trays in a warm location inside the house or in the glasshouse and keep well-watered.Do not allow the trays to dry out.It is important to keep the soil at the temperature between 12.7 and 21Â°C (55 and 70Â°F).The optimum temperature for germination is 60Â° to 70Â° (15Â° to 21Â° C) and the seedlings should emerge within 2â€“3 weeks.The seedlings can be potted into individual pots when the are about 5 cm (2 in) tall.Transplanting Seedlings are ready to transplant when they are 15 cm (6 in) tall and have been hardened off.Prepare the transplant site in advance of planting by working fertilizer or compost into the soil and plant the seedlings when the weather has settled after the last frost.
Seedling should be planted at the same depth as their previous container and should be spaced 15â€“20 cm (6â€“8 in) apart in rows spaced 60â€“90 cm (2â€“3 ft) apart. General care and maintenance Celery is a very heavy feeder and should be fed every 10â€“14 days with a balanced fertilizer.The plants require constant moisture and should be provided with at least 1 inch of water per week.A layer of mulch spread around the plants helps to conserve the moisture in the soil and prevents weeds.Any weeds should be gently removed from around the plants.If temperatures are forecast to drop below 12.7Â°C (55Â°F) then the plants should be protected with cloches to prevent them developing weak stalks.Prolonged exposure to temperatures below this threshold will result in bolting.Blanching Blanching is the act of deliberately covering plant parts to prevent photosynthesis, thus keeping the parts pale in color.Many people choose to blanch celery stalks to prevent them becoming bitter.
Self-blanching varieties are also available. To blanch celery, the soil can simply be mounded around the stalks to just below the leaves.This can be done gradually as the plants grow, or about two weeks prior to harvest.Alternatively, newspaper or cardboard can be tied around the stalks or boards can be erected around the plants to block out sunlight.Harvesting Celery can begin to be harvested when the stalks are about 20 cm (8 in) tall.Unblanched celery can be harvested as needed by cutting stalks from the outside in.Blanched celery can be harvested by cutting the plant just below the soil line.The plants can be kept in the garden until Fall and will tolerate a light frost but not continuous heavy frosts.If uncovered, the stalks will grow darker in color and the resultant texture will be more fibrous than the young stalks.A layer of mulch spread around the plants helps to conserve moisture For best results, celery should be started indoors References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.

Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Soft, rotting seeds which fail to germinate; rapid death of seedling prior to emergence from soil; collpase of seedlings after they have emerged from the soil caused by water-soaked reddish lesions girdling the stem at the soil line Cause Fungi Comments Damping-off diseases favor conditions which slow seed germination; fungi can be spread in water, contaminated soil or on equipment Management Avoid planting celery in poorly draining, cool, wet soil; planting in raised beds will help with soil drainage; plant high quality seed that germinates quickly; treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting to eliminate fungal pathogens Category : Fungal Downy mildew Peronospora umbellifarum Symptoms Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; white fluffy growth on underside of leaves; lesions become darker as the mature Cause Fungus Comments Disease affects young, tender leaves; disease emergence and spread is favored by prolonged leaf wetness Management Plant pathogen-free seed; do not overcrowd plants; rotate crops with non-umbelliferous varieties Early blight (Cercospora leaf spot, Cercospora blight) Cercospora apii Symptoms of Cercospora on celery Symptoms of Cercospora on celery Symptoms of Cercospora on celery Symptoms of Cercospora on celery Symptoms of Cercospora on celery Symptoms of Cercospora on celery Symptoms Small yellow flecks on upper and lower leaf surfaces which enlarge to brown-gray spots with no defined border; lesions develop a papery texture; leaves with many lesions may turn necrotic and die Cause Fungus Comments Fields become infected through infested seed; disease emergence is favored by warm temperatures and prolonged leaf wetness; disease can be differentiated from late blight by the absence of black fungal fruiting bodies embedded in leaves and the typically larger lesions Management In areas where warm temperatures and high humidity favor the emergence of early blight, control must rely on a number of different methods: plant pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; avoid overcrowding plants; plant tolerant or resistant celery varieties when conditions are favorable to early blight emergence; apply appropriate fungicides where available Fusarium yellows Fusarium oxysporum Symptoms Yellowing plants that are severely stunted; roots brown and water-soaked; discoloration of vascular tissue in the stems Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can persist indefinitely in soil once introduced and is usually introduced via infected transplants or contaminated equipment; disease emergence is favored by a soil pH which is close to 7 Management The most effective method of controlling Fusarium yellows is to prevent its introduction by regularly sanitizing tools and equipment, planting in pathogen-free soil and planting resistant or tolerant varieties of celery Late blight (Septoria leaf blight) Septoria apiicola Septoria blight symptoms on celery Necrotic lesions on celery foliage caused by infection with Septoria fungus Necrotic lesions on celery foliage caused by infection with Septoria fungus Symptoms Irregularly shaped chlorotic spots on leaves and petioles which turn necrotic and coalesce to form large necrotic areas, blighting of leaves and leaf death; back fungal fruiting bodies are visible embedded in leaf tissue and resemble peppercorns Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive on seed for up to 2 years in storage; emergence of disease if favored by heavy rainfall and dense leaf canopies which prevent air circulation; fungus can be spread via rainfall or contaminated irrigation water and by the movement of people, tools or machinery Management Plant pathogen-free seed; treat seed with fungicide or hot water prior top planting; if disease is present, avoid working in area when plants are wet; apply appropriate foliar fungicides where available` Pink rot Sclerotinia scerlotiotum Symptoms Soft, brown lesions on base of stalks with pink margin which cause the entire stalk to rot, turn brown and collapse; large black fungal fruiting bodies are visible on infected tissue; when young seedling are infected, the fungus causing damping-off with a watery rot visibly on the seedling stems near the soil line Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for up to 10 years; disease emergence is favored by soils that are held close to saturation for periods in excess of 2 weeks Management Cultural practices play an important role in the control of pink rot: the use of drip irrigation 5-8 cm below the soil surface can provide good control; deep plowing of soil and trimming back foliage to promote air circulation can also be useful; fungicides may be warranted in periods of extended cool, damp weather Powdery mildew Erisyphe heraclei Symptoms Powdery growth on leaves, petioles flowers stalks and bracts; leaves becoming chlorotic; severe infections can cause flowers to become distorted Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can spread long distances in air; disease emergence is favored by high humidity and moderate temperatures; infection is most severe in shaded areas Management Plant tolerant varieties; avoid excess fertilization; protective fungicide applications provide adequate protection; sulfur application can be used in infection occurs early in season Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Carrot-williow aphids, Peach aphid, Hawthorn aohid, Melon aphid) Cavariella aegopodii Myzus persicae Dysaphis apiifolia Aphis gossypii Carrot-willow aphid colony Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants.
Cause Insects Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; aphids can build up to several thousand per celery plant. Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Armyworm Pseudaletia unipuncta Armyworm Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.

The chard plant has an erect growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves with long fleshy petioles which can be red or white in color. The leaves are large and wrinkled with a pronounced midrib and prominent veins.The chard plant can reach 30â€“40 cm (12â€“16 in) in height and is usually grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season.Chard may also be referred to as Swiss chard or silverbeet and likely originates from the Mediterranean.Chard stalks Harvested leaves Harvested stalks Colorful stems Chard foliage Chard leaf Chard seedlings Chard leaves Chard leaf Uses Chard Content All parts of the chard plant are edible.The leaves and petioles (leaf stalks) are usually consumed after cooking with the former being eaten in a similar way to spinach and the latter similar to asparagus.Propagation Basic requirements Chard is best grown in moist, fertile, and organically rich soils.The soil should be light to sandy, and well drained with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.
The plants should be positioned in full sun or light shade. Chard grows best in cool climates and can tolerate moderate frosts although prolonged freezing will cause some varieties to bolt.The optimum temperature for growth is between 15.5 and 18.3Â°C (60â€“65Â°F).Planting Seed may be sown in the ground 30 days prior to the last spring frost as the seedlings are tolerant to moderate frost.Plant one seed every 2.5 cm (1 in) at a depth of 13 mm (0.5 in) in rows spaced 30â€“40 cm (12â€“16 in) apart.Keep the seedbed well watered.Seedling should emerge in 5 to 17 days at temperatures between 10 and 24Â°C (50â€“75Â°F).When seedlings have reached between 7 and 10 cm (3â€“4 in) in height, thin to a final spacing of 7â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in) between plants.If planning to harvest entire plants at one time, plant seeds every 2â€“3 weeks to ensure a continuous supply.General care and maintenance Chard requires plenty of moisture to develop optimally.
Even watering will promote the development of good quality roots. Soil moisture can be conserved by applying a layer of mulch around the plants.In addition to moisture, chard benefits from an adequate supply of nutrients.Apply a complete fertilizer at planting to ensure optimum development.Remove any weeds around plants by cultivating shallowly to avoid damaging the developing roots.Harvesting Leaves can be cut from the plant at any point after they develop but if plant is to reach maturity then it is best to remove the outer leaves that have fully developed first.References Anderson, C.R.Home Gardening Series.Chard.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-6065.pdf.[Accessed 10 November 14].Free to access .Drost, D.(2005).Swiss Chard in the Garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://extension.usu.edu/boxelder/files/uploads/Vegetable%20Gardens/chard08-14.pdf.[Accessed 10 November 14].

Cherry trees have alternating simple oval leaves which often have serrated margins and approximately eight pairs of veins, 5â€“13 cm (2â€“5 in) long. The flowers are white and appear in clusters of about 3â€“5.They appear in early spring and are about one inch long.The fruit is dark red, about half an inch to a full inch, matures in early to mid summer.The bark is gray-brown, smooth and glossy and it often peels.Cherry trees can live up to 60 years, growing to a height of over 15 m (50 ft).Cherry may also be referred to as sweet cherry, gean, mazzard or wild cherry and originates from the Caspian- Black Sea region and Asia.Sour cherry, Prunus cerasus , is closely related to Prunus avium but with fruit that is more acidic.The tree has twiggy branches with bright red to near black cherries.
The tree reaches a height of 4â€“10 m (13.1â€“16.4 ft) and is believed to have originated as a natural hybrid of wild cherry ( Prunus avium ) and ground cherry ( Prunus fruticosa ) somewhere in the Caucasus Mountains, Turkey or Eastern Europe where the two species' geographic ranges overlap. Cherry orchard Cherry blossoms Cherry blossom Buds on cherry tree Ripe cherries Cherries Uses Cherry (including sour) Content Uses Cherries are mainly consumed as a fresh fruit or processed into jellies and juices.The wood of the cherry tree is a distinctive honey color and is used in furniture making and for musical instruments.Sour cherries are used mainly for canning and processing.Propagation Basic requirements Cherries grow optimally in mild, dry climates and also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy so require cold winters.Because of the cold weather requirement, none of the Prunus family, including cherries, can grow in tropical climates.
Cherry trees will grow in a variety of soils provided that they are well-draining. Soils which remain wet for prolonged periods of time and soils that become excessively dry should be avoided.Trees will perform best if planted in sandy soil with a pH of 5.5â€“7.5.Planting on a gentle slope is beneficial for cherry as cold air can drain away from the trees to lower areas, helping to prevent damage.Sweet cherries bloom earlier than sour cherries and can be susceptible to damage from late frosts.Propagation Cherry nurseries are mainly propagated by budding and grafting onto 1â€“2 year old seedling grown from seed.In order to grow from seed, pits should be planted in the fall (after first being chilled) and seedlings will emerge in the spring.A cherry tree will take three-four years to produce its first crop of fruit and seven years to attain full maturity.Planting Cherry trees should be planted in the Spring when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed.
If bare root plants have been purchased, be sure to keep the root ball moist prior to planting. The tree should be planted in a hole which is large enough to accommodate the root ball without bending any of the roots.Broken or damaged roots can be removed but try to avoid pruning the roots.Place the tree in the planting hole and carefully backfill with soil.The tree should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery.Carefully firm or tamp the soil to prevent air pockets and when the planting hole is about 2/3 filled, water the roots thoroughly before filling the remainder of the hole with top soil.The tree should be watered as needed throughout the first year of growth.Training and pruning Cherry trees are usually trained to a modified central leader system where the lateral limbs branch from a central trunk.Sweet cherries have a more upright growth habit than sour cherries which tend to have a more open and spreading canopy.
Trees should only pruned lightly while the tree matures and reaches maximum productivity. Any dead or damaged branches should be removed.General care and maintenance The area around the base of the tree should be kept free from weeds either by cultivating or using a chemical weed control.In the home garden, trees are usually surrounded by turf with only a small area of soil around the trunk which is easy to keep weed free by hand.Unless grown in fertile soils, cherry trees may require the addition of some nitrogen fertilizer, the volume of which will vary with the age of the tree.The fertilizer should be applied in a band around the trunk of the tree.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Prunus avium datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/44250.[Accessed 10 November 14].Paid subscription required .Ogawa, J.M., Zehr, E.I., Bird, G.W., Ritchie, D.F., Uriu, K.& Uyemoto, J.K.(Eds).(1995).Compendium of Stone Fruit Diseases.

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Bacterial Bacterial canker Pseudomonas syringae Symptoms Cankers on twigs at bases of flower and leaf buds, in pruning wounds or at the base of spurs which exude amber colored gum; cankers spread upwards and form sunken areas in winter; if pathogen enters dormant buds they may be killed or open normally in Spring before collapsing in early Summer; infected buds may be symptomless Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors high moisture and low temperatures in the spring; young trees particularly susceptible; trees grown in sandy soils that drain poorly are also susceptible Management Ensure that a suitable cherry variety and rootstock is chosen based on geographic location and environmental conditions to prevent stress to tree which predisposes tree to canker disease; apply protective copper spray to trees before flowering; prune trees in early summer to decrease likelihood of infection Category : Fungal Black knot Apiosporina morbosa Black knot symptoms on cherry Black knot on black cherry stem Black knot symptoms on cherry Symptoms Elongated swellings (knots) on woody parts of tree which can reach up to 30 cm (12 in) long; knots are initially olive green in color with a corky texture but turn black in color and become hard and brittle; knots grow in length each year Cause Fungus Comments Infections occur on new shoots after rainfall and knots develop rapidly in second year Management Prune knots on twigs and branches 8-10 cm (3-4 in) below the swelling and remove the pruned branches from the orchard; remove knots on older branches by removing the knot plus 2 cm (0.8 in) of surrounding tissue; removal of knots is most effective when done in midsummer; disease can be controlled by application of appropriate fungicides, if available, during shoot elongation Brown rot Monilinia fructicola Cherry fruits infected with brown rot fungus Symptoms Brown discoloration of fruit skin and inner tissue; fruit skin wrinkled; collapsed flowers exuding sap from their bases; tan cankers with dark edges on twigs; gray-brown spore masses may be present on cankers Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives in mummified fruit on the tree, blighted blossoms, cankers and infected twigs; blossom and twig blights are promoted by periods of wet weather Management The currently most effective method of controlling brown rot is through the application of appropriate protective fungicides timed so that they are applied when the susceptible flower parts are exposed or after a wet period; avoiding sprinkler irrigation protects the leaves and flowers from wetness that promotes the disease.
Cultural control methods include: removing mummified fruit from tree, pruning infected twigs and reducing plant stress by providing adequate levels of water and fertilizer Cherry leaf spot Coccomyces hiemalis Cherry leaf spot lesions on sweet cherry leaf Cherry leaf spot lesions on sweet cherry leaf Symptoms Small, red-purple spots on upper surfaces of leaves which turn brown and may coalesce; leaves may become chlorotic if there are a few lesions present; if tree becomes severely defoliated fruit may fail to develop properly and remain light in color and watery in texture Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters on infected leaves on the ground; disease development is promoted by warm temperatures and high humidity Management Disease can be controlled through applications of appropriate fungicides, Bordeaux mixture is also effective; no cherry varieties are resistant to leaf spot, plant less susceptible varieties if available Powdery mildew Podosphaera spp.
Symptoms Light colored circular lesions on leaves inside tree canopy which develop a powdery appearance; lesions may coalesce to cover leaf; if infection is severe, leaves may blister and infected shoots may be distorted and stunted; infected fruits may have slightly depressed areas on the surface containing fungal hyphae (filamentous fungal structures) Cause Fungus Comments Infection of fruit is more likely if there are rainfalls close to harvest Management Management of powdery mildew in cherry is reliant on the application of appropriate fungicides and cultural practices which promote good air circulation around tree canopies to lower humidity Rust Tranzschelia discolor Symptoms Pale yellow-green spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces which are angular in shape and turn bright yellow in color; spots on lower leaf surface develop orange-red spores Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in twigs or in leaves which remain attached to the tree Management Rust can be prevented by spraying trees with protective fungicides; application is usually carried out one, two and three months before harvest in areas prone to early season outbreaks of the disease and after harvest in areas where disease is less problematic or emerges later in the season Silver leaf Chondrosterum pupureum Symptoms Leaves have a silvery appearance; if infection is severe the leaves may curl upwards and become necrotic; death of individual limbs or entire tree may occur; fungal fruiting bodies appear on the surface of the dead bark Cause Fungus Comments Pathogen is spread via spores released after rainfall during periods of high humidity and can enter trees through pruning wounds; risk of infection is increased if tree is pruned during late winter or early spring; trees also susceptible when they are heavily pruned Management Control of silver leaf disease is difficult and infection can be widespread after rainfall in areas where the disease is present; strategies to reduce the incidence of the disease include: removing all plant debris e.g.
pruning waste, stumps, and logs; pruning tree during dry periods and treating large pruning wounds with fungicidal dressing Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae Symptoms of Verticillium wilt on sweet cherry tree Symptoms Withering of leaves on one or more spurs on 1 year old wood; leaves are dull and stunted; fruit small; older cherry trees do not recover from disease Cause Fungus Comments Disease is more severe in wet soils Management Plant cherry in soil with no history of disease; keep trees adequately fertilized and watered Category : Viral Cherry rasp leaf Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) Cherry leaves infected with cherry rasp leaf Symptoms Leaf like growths (enations) on underside of leaves near center; symptoms spread from lower parts of tree upwards; defoliation of limbs; decline of tree Cause Virus Comments Distinguished from PNRSV by the leaves remaining green; virus is transmitted by nematodes and through grafting Management Fumigants to control nematodes may control cherry rasp leaf Sour cherry yellows Prune dwarf virus (PDV) Symptoms Chlorotic rings or mottled pattern on newly expanded leaves of sour cherry which become necrotic and may drop out of leaves, giving them a shot hole appearance; leaves that expand after the initial symptoms have become visible display lesser and lesser symptoms; one or more years later leaves on infected trees become yellow with green mottle and drop from tree; fruit yield may be reduced by up to 50%; sweet cherry trees develop chlorotic spots or rings with some shot holes; fruiting spurs decrease in later years as the disease progresses; fruit on infected trees are generally firmer and larger than on uninfected Cause Virus Comments Virus can infect a wide range of Prunus species Management No control strategies are currently known; always purchase certified, disease-free material Category : Oomycete Crown and root rot Phytophthora spp.
Symptoms Poor new growth; leaves chlorotic, small in size and sparse; fruit may be small, brightly colored and susceptible to sunburn; shoots may suffer from dieback and tree will often die within weeks or months of first signs of infection or decline gradually over several seasons; root crown may show signs of decay which develops into a canker; bark of infected crown tissue turns dark brown; cankers may occur on aerial parts of plant Cause Oomycete Comments Symptoms can be similar to those of bacterial infections or mechanical damage; severity of disease is linked to soil moisture content; water-saturated soils promote development of disease Management Management of phytophthora is reliant on good management of water: cherry trees should be planted in well-draining soil to minimize the frequency and duration of water saturated soil; trees should be propagated from resistant rootstock and application of appropriate systemic fungicides may provide some protection from the disease Category : Bacterial, Fungal Crown gall Agrobacterium spp Symptoms Galls on root and/or crown of tree which can range in size from so small they are not visible to the naked eye up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter; galls first become visible as white, fleshy swellings that grow rapidly and become tan to brown in color; galls typically develop at the site of a wound and new galls form adjacent to old ones the next year Cause Bacterium Comments Infection with crown gall begins at the site of plant wounds; disease emergence is favored by poorly-drained, alkaline soils and previous feeding damage by nematodes Management Chemical control of the disease is generally ineffective; an effective bacterial biological control is available for commercial production; cultural control methods include: planting only certified, disease-free material, planting cherry in well-draining soil, rotating infected fields with a non-host before peach is planted and also using good sanitation practices Category : Other X-disease X-disease mycoplasma-like organism (MLO) Graft union on a Bing cherry tree (on mahaleb rootstock) infected with X- disease Delayed fruit maturity caused by X- disease Symptoms Rapid or slow decline of tree depending on rootstock; in hypersensitive rootstocks such as Prunus mahaleb cherry scion is rapidly girdled; cherry grafted on susceptible rootstocks exhibit a slow decline over a number of years; leaves on infected limbs are small with a red tinge; fruit may mature late and color development may be incomplete; limbs experience dieback and the tree is killed Cause Mycoplasma-like organism Comments Disease is transmitted by cherry leafhoppers Management Most practical control method for X-disease is to remove infected trees and other plant sources which act as a disease reservoir e.g.
chokeberry Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Black cherry aphid) Myzus cerasi Aphid colony on sour cherry Black cherry aphids Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant which are shiny and black in color; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Aphids overwinter as eggs on trees and young nymphs hatch and feed at growing tips; winged aphids will migrate to plants in the mustard family during the summer months Management Remove any mustard volunteers growing in proximity to cherry; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use; aphids are best treated when cherry is dormant and insect is at the egg stage; if population has not been controlled by the treatment during dormancy then it should be reapplied at petal fall Peach twig borer Anarsia lineatella Peach twig borer Symptoms Death of shoot tips; feeding damage to fruit, usually at stem end; larvae are dark brown and white with a black head; adult insect is a gray-brown moth Cause Insect Comments Peach twig borers overwinter as larvae in a specialized cell known as a hibernaculum; overwintering sites are located in rough areas of bark on 1 to 4 year old wood in crotch of limbs Management Most effective method of treatment is well-timed applications of insecticide around time of bloom; organically acceptable insecticides include Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust; infestations can also be treated with appropriate organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides Western cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis indifferens Symptoms Fruit mushy and contains a single white maggot; adult insect is a fly with a black body and white bands on the abdomen and a distinctive dark banded pattern on their wings Cause Insect Comments Western cherry fruit flies are a potentially damaging pest in all western statues of the US; high populations can result in a maggot being found in every single fruit Management In commercial cherry plantations, western cherry fruit flies should be monitored using yellow sticky traps, the most effective being one with an ammonium carbonate lure; the insect is a quarantine pest and if a single fruit is found to be infested, treatment is warranted - even if no adults have been found on sticky traps; chemical treatments should be timed to target mature, egg-laying females in your particular region; recommended chemicals include spinosad, carbaryl, malathion, and acetamiprid; home growers should also treat trees to help control this damaging pest Category : Mites Spider mites (e.g.
Two-spotted spider mite) Tetranychus urticae Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant Cause About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap tor 1% horticultural oil to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Chestnut ( Castanea spp.) is a deciduous tree in the family Fagaceae grown for its edible seeds (nuts).
The chestnut tree has a thick trunk covered in gray bark. The trunk has an erect growth habit and can grow 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter.When the tree stands alone, the canopy can spread 15 m (49 ft) across and is made up of glossy leaves with serrated margins and pointed tips.The leaves are hairy with visible glands on the underside.The chestnut tree produces flowers on long catkins and the seeds are produced in clusters of 1â€“3.The seeds are covered by a thick, spiny bur which is approximately 10 cm (4 in) in diameter.The kernel within is protected by a thin, dark brown shell.Chestnut trees can reach 40â€“60 m (131â€“198 ft) in height and can live for in excess of 150 years.Chestnut may also be referred to by variety and includes European, American, Japanese and Spanish chestnut.The tree originates from Asia.
Chestnut Chestnuts Chestnut on tree Chestnut tree Chestnut leaves Chestnut burs on the tree split to reveal the kernel Uses Chestnut Content Chestnuts are commonly consumed after roasting or may be processed to produce chestnut creams and purees or for canning. Propagation Basic requirements Chestnuts are hardy trees which will grow in a variety of conditions.The trees grow best in well- draining, acid loam soils and require a pH between 4.5 and 6.5.The trees perform well when planted on a gentle slope which allows cold air to drain to a lower area as well as aiding in soil drainage.Chestnuts should be planted in full sunlight and open fields are preferred for maximum nut production.Chestnut has poor self compatibility and at least 2 trees are required for nut production.Propagation Chestnut trees can be grown from seeds or can be propagated by grafting onto a seedling rootstock.
Seedling grown for use as a rootstock for grafting are usually ready to receive a scion when they are two years old. The seedling must have reached a suitable thickness in order to receive a graft (usually when it reaches a thickness similar to that of a pencil).Germinating seeds Chestnut seeds germinate readily but not all will produce a seedling suitable for planting and/or grafting.Seeds can be obtained from breeders or collected from chestnut trees in the Fall.Seeds should be kept refrigerated until planting and can then be directed seeded outdoors or grown in containers inside.Seeds should be planted in early Spring as soon as the soil can be worked.The seed should be planted in a hole 7.5 to 15.0 cm (3-6 in) deep with the radicle (embryo emerging from the seed) facing downwards.If planting in a container, be sure to choose one that is at least 30 cm (12 in) deep and 10 cm (4 in) in diameter.The seeds can be planted earlier if the containers are to be kept indoors.
Planting seedlings Seedlings started in containers can be transplanted after all danger of frost has passed and after hardening. The seedling should be planted in a hole that is at least 1.5 times the size of the existing root ball.Gently remove the remnants of the nut from the roots and place the seedling in the hole.Backfill the hole with soil and tamp to remove air pockets.Seedlings should be planted 10â€“12 m (33â€“39 ft) apart, allowing an additional 10â€“12 m (33â€“39 ft) between rows.After planting, the seedlings should be watered thoroughly.Continue watering the seed for the first month after planting to help the seedling establish.General care and maintenance After planting, the areas around the trees should be kept free from weeds.A layer of mulch spread around the trunks will help suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture.You may have to protect the young trees from pests such as deer which can cause severe damage to the trees.
The most effective method of protecting trees is to erect an 8 ft high metal deer fence around the area where the new trees have been planted.

The plant has a branched, straight or bending stem with small feathery leaves arranged alternately on the stem. The leaves are composed of 11â€“15 individual leaflets which are oval in shape.The flowers are produced singly or in pairs and can be white, pink, purple or blue in color.The seed pod is rhomboid or ellipsoid and contains 1â€“4 cream, brown, green or black seeds.The chickpea plant can range in height from 20 cm (7.9 in) up to 100 cm (39.4 in) and as an annual, grows over only one growing season.Chickpea may also be referred to as gram pea, garbanzo bean or ceci bean and originate from south-eastern Turkey.Chickpea pods White chickpea flower Commercially grown chickpea Chickpea seedling Chickpea plant Purple chickpea flower Uses Chickpea is primarily consumed as a dry pulse.The shelled peas are eaten as snack or vegetable.The seed husks can be used as a feed for animals.
Chickpeas are also commonly cooked and ground into a paste to produce the popular dish, Chickpea (gram pea) Content hummus. Propagation General requirements Chickpeas are cool-season legumes which are best grown as a winter crop in the tropics or as a spring or summer crop in temperate regions.Chickpeas are classified into two distinct types based on seed characteristics.Desi chickpeas have a thick, colored seed coat and the surface of the seed is rough and angular whereas the Kabuli type have white or beige seeds with a smooth surface.Kabuli chickpeas are best grown in temperate areas whereas Desi chickpeas are best suited to semi-arid areas of the tropics.Chickpeas will grow optimally at temperatures between 15 and 29Â°C (59â€“84.2Â°F) with extremes of temperature above 35Â°C (95Â°F) and below 15Â°C (59Â°F) causing flowers to drop, reducing production.
Plants will perform best when planted in well-draining sandy loam soils with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0 in areas where the annual rainfall is between 600 and 1000 mm. Planting Chickpeas are propagated directly from seed with timing of planting depending on the variety being grown and geographic location.Spring crops should be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 5Â°C (41Â°F).Chickpeas are leguminous and when planting in a site which has not previously been used for chickpea cultivation, seed should be inoculated with an appropriate type of Rhizobacteria prior to planting.Seed is usually spread by broadcasting or by drilling in rows.Desi types require a seed rate of 30 to 40 kg per hectare whereas Kabuli types require 80 to 100 kg per hectare.The seed should be planted 2 to 12 cm (0.8â€“4.7 in) deep and when planting in rows, seed should be spaced 10 cm (4 in) apart allowing 25 to 60 cm (9.8 to 23.6 in) between rows.
Seedlings usually emerge between 7 and 15 days after sowing depending on temperature. General care In the home garden, chickpea seedlings will benefit from the addition of a layer of mulch after they have emerged to suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture.Plants should be provided with additional irrigation during periods of dry weather but care should be taken not to overwater as this can cause the plants to drop their flowers and/or pods.Application of fertilizer is generally not necessary as chickpeas are leguminous and fix their own nitrogen with the aid of micro-organisms but requirements vary from field to field and management should be based on the results of a soil test.Like other pulses, chickpeas require phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients for growth and application should be based on the results of soil testing.Suppression of weeds in commercial fields is important as chickpeas do not compete well and weed will reduce productivity.
Pre- and post-emergence herbicide applications can be helpful for managing weed. If a field has a history of weed problems then it is not suitable for chickpea production.Harvesting Chickpeas are ready to harvest approximately 100 days after planting.in the home garden, chickpeas can be collected and eaten when green but for dried seeds, the leaves should be allowed to turn brown before collecting the pods.The pods should be allowed to dry and split open before collecting seeds.In commercial production, chickpeas can be harvested by swathing and/or combine.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Cicer arietinum datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13475.[Accessed 11 November 14].Paid subscription required .Gaur, P.M., Tripathi, S., Gowda, C.L.L., Ranga Rao, G.V., Sharma, H.C., Pande, S.& Sharma, M.(2010).Chickpea Seed Production Manual.International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics.

dark, rotten tap roots; gray fibrous fungal threads on the tap root Cause Fungus Comments Favors high temperature and low moisture Management No fungicides provide effective control of the disease and management therefore relies on cultural practices; utilize adequate plant spacing to avoid overcrowding and competition for water which can promote the disease; crop rotation to a non-host may help reduce the population in the soil Phytophthora root rot Phytophthora megasperma Symptoms Leaves of plants turning yellow and drying out; decaying roots; small brown lesions on roots which enlarge and create necrotic patches; lesions may girdle stem Cause Oomycete Comments Favors warm, wet soil Management Varieties with resistance to the disease are available in most areas where root rot is a problem Pests Category : Insects Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; larvae are dark green to brown caterpillars with banding patterns Cause Insect Comments Beet armyworm is a serious pest of chickpea in India and Mexico; Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Chickpea leafminer Liriomyza cicerina Symptoms Leaves may have a stippled appearance from females puncturing leaf with ovipositor to feed on exudate; female lays eggs under leaf surface and newly hatched larvae damage the leaf by feeding on the inner tissues; feeding damage from larvae causes the development of winding white trails of the leaf surface; if feeding damage is extensive, the entire leaf may dry out and drop from the plant; damage to young seedlings may result in the death of the plant; crop yield may be reduced Cause Insect Comments Chickpea leafminers can cause heavy losses in North Africa, West Asia and Northern Europe Management Cultural control methods include planting chickpeas in early winter instead of Spring when the populations of the insects are at less damaging levels; crop debris should be plowed deeply into the soil to destroy overwintering pupae; chickpea cultivars with smaller leaf sizes are less attractive to leafminers; insects may be controlled through the application of appropriate chemical insecticides Cowpea aphid (Black aphid) Aphis craccivora Symptoms Deformed leaves and shoots; curled leaves; if infestation is severe then plants may be killed; seed fill and yield may be reduced; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants; adult insect is small and soft bodied and is easily distinguished from other aphids by its shiny-black color Cause Insect Comments Black aphids can cause severe damage when infestation is high but more commonly cause problems in chickpea crops through the transmission of several plant viruses Management Plants should be monitored for signs of aphids; if insects are present then control measures should be implemented; some chickpea cultivars are more susceptible to aphid infestation than others - cultivars with a low density of trichomes (leaf hairs) are more susceptible than others; chemical control may be warranted although aphids have developed resistance to several insecticides in India; cultural control methods include early planting which promotes early closure of the plant canopy and reduced the spread of viruses; aphid infestations tend to be worse when broad plant spacing is employed Cutworms (Black cutworm, Winter cutworm) Agrotis ipsilon Agrotis segetum Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insect Comments Favors late tillage and planting; major pest for corn and will start attacking everything else after corn is rotated out Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Pod borers ( Cotton bollworm, Australian bollworm ) Helicoverpa armigera Helicoverpa punctigera Large Helicoverpa punctigera (left) and H.

punctigera without saddle (bottom) Symptoms Young larvae feed on foliage initially; young chickpea plants may be completely destroyed; older larvae bore into seed pods and consume seeds; insect frass (feces) may be present outside the feeding holes Cause Insects Comments Helicoverpa armigera is widely distributed in Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Mediterranean; also a pest of cotton, pigeonpea, sunflower, tomato, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, okra, beans, tobacco, linseed and a number of fruit trees; Helicoverpa punctigera is a major pest of chickpea in Australia About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms Management The insect can be very damaging in the areas where it occurs and plants should be monitored carefully for presence of larvae; identifying the species of Helicoverpa present can be important for management decisions as H.
armigera is resistant to some insecticides (particularly synthetic pyrethroids), while H. punctigera is susceptible to all insecticides; small larvae should be distinguished with the use of a hand lens or microscope; young H.armigera larvae have a distinctive saddle on the fourth body segment which is absent from the larvae of H.punctigera (see image); older larvae can be distinguished by the color of the hairs behind the head - H.armigera possess white hairs, while H.punctigera have black hairs; both types of larvae may also be controlled organically via release of natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Common chicory, Cichorium intybus , is a perennial herb in the family Asteraceae grown for use as a salad green.
Generally, chicory plants have an erect growth habit with numerous lanceolate (lance shaped) leaves branching off of the erect stems. The basal leaves can reach 25 cm (9.8 in) in length and are spatulate (spoon-shaped) and may be green or red in color.There are two rows of bracts (modified leaves) on the stems, the inner are longer and erect and the outer are shorter and spreading The foliage is commonly covered in hairs.The plant produces bright blue or sometimes pink or white flowers which are 2â€“4 cm (0.79â€“1.6 in) in diameter.Chicory can grow to a height of 0.6â€“1.2 m (2.0â€“3.9 ft) and is usually grown as a biennial.Chicory may also be referred to by variety and these include Common chicory, Italian dandelion, Witloof, Belgian endive and radicchio.Chicory likely originates from the Mediterranean.Chicory foliage Radicchio Belgian endive Uses Chicory is predominantly grown for its leaves which are used as salad greens or cooked.
The witloof variety is also grown for its root which can be ground and used as a coffee substitute. Propagation Chicory Content Propagation Basic requirements Many types of chicory are available for the home garden and the chosen variety depends ultimately on its desired use.Radicchio types are grown for their leaves whereas witloof types may be grown for their roots and leaves.Chicory is a cool season crop and radicchio varieties require cool temperatures to produce heads.Plants will grows best in fertile, well draining soils with a pH between 6.5 and 7.2 and should be positioned in full sun.Planting Chicory can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplanting.If started indoors, seeds should be sown in a sterile seed starting mix by planting to a depth of 0.6 cm (0.25 in).Thin the seedlings when they have 3 to 4 sets of true leaves.The seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are about 5 to 6 weeks old and have 5 or six mature leaves.
Seedlings should be hardened prior to transplanting by gradually increasing their exposure to outdoor conditions. Space seedlings 20 to 23 cm (8-9 in) apart allowing 20 cm (8 in) between rows.Directly seeded plants should be thinned to this spacing.General care and maintenance Plants should be protected from frosts with row covers or fabric to prevent damage.The plants will benefit from a layer of organic mulch such as grass clippings or leaves which will help to suppress weeds while conserving moisture in the soil.Plants should be kept moist during growth to prevent the development of bitter tasting leaves.Chicory generally requires 1 to 2 inches of water a week but this will depend on the type of soil and the prevailing climatic conditions.Harvesting Radicchio varieties should be harvested when the leaves have reached their full size.Harvesting should not be delayed as it results in the leaves developing a bitter flavor.
Cut the head from the plant using a sharp knife to cut through the stem just below the head. Witloof varieties grown for leaves should be harvested while the leaves are young and tender.If the plants are being grown for their roots then they should be pulled from the soil just before the last frost date.The leaves should be trimmed to about 2.5 cm from the crown and the roots should be trimmed to a uniform size.Store the trimmed plants at 0Â°C (32Â°F) for 5 to 7 weeks before forcing.Forcing Forcing is the term used to describe the process by which witloof chicory varieties are forced to produce new growth in winter.
The forcing process is commonly carried out by transplanting the plants into sand filled boxes or buckets which are then stored in a frost free place such as a glasshouse, shed or basement where temperatures are between 10 and 15.55Â°C (50-60Â°F).The chicory plants should be planted in the sand, leaving the crown exposed and then either kept in darkness if in a basement or covered if in a glasshouse. It is important that no light is able to reach the plants.The plant will begin to produce a tightly packed head of leaves called a chicon.Chicons are ready for harvest within 3-5 weeks.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Cichorium intybus datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13409.[Accessed 11 November 14].Paid subscription required .Hall, M.H.& Jung, G.A.(2008).Forage Chicory.Penn State Extension.Available at: http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/uc116.pdf.[Accessed 11 November 14].Free to access .USDA (2003).Chicory.The U.S.

(C. annuum, C.frutescens) Order / Family Solanales: Solanaceae Local Names Pilipili (Swahili) Common Names Sweet pepper, Bell pepper, Chilli, Hot pepper General Information All chilli peppers are varieties of several plant species in the genus Capsicum , including Capsicum annuum (e.g.jalapeÃ±os and cayennes), C.frutescens (e.g.tabasco and piri piri), C.chinense (e.g.habaneros and Scotch bonnet), C.pubescens (e.g.rocoto and locoto) and C.baccatum (e.g.aji peppers) and their hybrids which include some of the hottest peppers known.Unsurprisingly, the plants are most commonly grown for the harvest of their fruits, which are used as a spice.Hot peppers are perennial plants with varying structure.They can be herbaceous or shrub-like but are generally branching with green-brown stems and simple oval leaves.The plants produces flowers with five teeth (petals) which are usually white in color.
Chilli pepper plants can reach heights in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 m (1.6â€“4.9 ft) tall and although they are perennial species, they are commonly grown as annuals, with fruit being harvested for one growing season. Chilli Pepper Content Chilli peppers may also be referred to as hot peppers or hot chillis.C.annuum species are believed to have originated from Mexico, while the others are all likely to have originated from South America.Chilli pepper flower Habaneros Pepper flower buds Thai chilli peppers Habanero fruits ripening on the plant Cayenne pepper fruit climatic conditions, soil and water management Capsicum peppers tend to tolerate shade conditions up to 45% of prevailing solar radiation, although shade may delay flowering.Capsicum peppers grow best on well-drained loamy soils at pH 5.5-6.8.They grow at a wide range of altitudes, with rainfall between 600- and 1250-mm.Severe flooding or drought is injurious to most cultivars.Seeds germinate best at 25-30Â°C.
Optimal temperatures for productivity are between 18 and 30Â°C. C.frutescens are more tolerant to high temperatures.Cooler night temperatures down to 15Â°C favor fruit setting, although flowering will be delayed as temperatures drop below 25Â°C.Flower buds will usually abort rather than develop to maturity if night temperatures reach 30Â°C.Pollen viability is significantly reduced at temperatures above 30Â°C and below 15Â°C.Chillie paper varieties Cultivars commonly grown in Kenya: Sweet pepper (C.annuum): California Wonder Yolo wonder Emerald Giant Ruby Giant Hot pepper (C.frutescens) Anaheim Fresno Jalapeno Long Red Cayenne Rocket Short Bullet Nutrition Value Chili peppers have amazingly high levels of vitamins and minerals.
Just 100 g provides (in % of recommended daily allowance): 240% of vitamin-C (Ascorbic acid), 39% of vitamin B-6 (Pyridoxine), 32% of vitamin A, 13% of iron, 14% of copper, 7% of potassium, Uses Hot peppers can be eaten fresh or cooked as a vegetable, seasoning or garnish. Propagation Basic requirements Peppers are warm-season crops and grow best at temperatures between 18 and 30Â°C (65â€“86Â°F).They can be grown in many soil types although sandy soils warm faster in Spring and are good for early planting.The soil should have a pH between 6 and 7.Peppers will not tolerate water saturated soil and should be planted in a well draining soil or raised bed.Peppers should be planted in an area that receives full sun for most of the day.Sowing seeds In most cases, pepper seeds should be started indoors 8â€“10 weeks before the last Spring frost.
Pepper should only be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season, otherwise seeds should be sown indoors in flats or cell trays using a sterile seedling mix. Plant seeds to a depth of 1.3 cm (1/2 in) and water lightly.Seeds should not be allowed to dry out as there will be a negative impact on germination rates.Trays should be positioned in a warm, bright, South facing window or under fluorescent lighting.The optimum soil temperature for germination is 21â€“29Â°C(70â€“85Â°F).A heat mat can be used to warm the flats if required.Seedlings will emerge within 8â€“25 days and after the seedlings has developed two sets of true leaves then they can be moved to a larger (3-4 in) pot.Seedlings should be provided with ample light and adequate fertilizer.Transplanting Peppers are usually transplanted 2â€“3 weeks after the last frost when the soil temperature has reached a minimum of 15.5Â°C (60Â°F).
Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting. Beginning approximately 7â€“10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264).The hardening off process is very important as peppers are very susceptible to transplant shock.The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth.When transplanting seedlings, allow 30â€“45 cm (12â€“18 in) between plants and 60â€“76 cm (24â€“30 in) between rows.Side dress plants with a nitrogen fertilizer at planting.Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist.Mulching around the plants can also help to conserve soil moisture.
General care and maintenance Peppers will benefit from applications of fertilizer to keep them supplied with essential nutrients. A timed release fertilizer can be applied at bloom or the plants can be fed with a liquid fertilizer at planting and every two weeks thereafter.In addition, pepper plants can produce a heavy load of fruit and it can be helpful to provide the plants with some support using stakes or cages to prevent branches from breaking under the weight.Use a soft material to tie plants to stakes or cages.Caged hot peppers Jalapeno seedlings Pepper seedlings References Burt, J.(2005).Growing capsicums and chillies.Government of Western Australia Department of Agriculture and Food.Available at: http://archive.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/hort/veg/cp/capsicums/f06499.pdf.[Accessed 11 November 14].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Capsicum datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/15783.[Accessed 11 November 14].

Pests Category : Insects Aphids Myzus persicae Potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) on chilli pepper leaves Aphids (and ladybug larva) on pepper leaf Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants. Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Beet armyworm egg mass hatching Damage caused by beet armyworm Late stage beet armyworm larva feeding on pepper leaf Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year.
Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae. Flea beetles Various Adult flea beetle on a leaf Flea beetles are often metallic in appearance Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny and metallic in appearance.
Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied.

Leafminer trails on pepper leaves Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larave hatch and feed on leaf interior. Cause Insects Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year.Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies.
Leafroller (Omnivorous leafroller) Platynota stultana Larvae of omnivorous leafroller (Platynota stultana) Adult omnivorous leafroller (Platynota stultana) Symptoms Leaves of plant rolled and tied together with silk webbing; feeding damage to rolled leaves; defoliation of plant; silk webbing may also be present on fruits and fruits may have substantial scarring from feeding damage; larvae wriggle vigorously when disturbed and may drop from plant on a silken thread. Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a moth which can fly over several miles to find suitable hosts; alfalfa and sugar beet are good hosts.Management Monitor plants regularly for signs of infestation; remove weeds from plant bases as they can act as hosts for leafrollers; avoid planting pepper in areas where sugarbeet or alfalfa are grown nearby; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; apply sprays carefully to ensure that treatment reaches inside rolled leaves.
Pepper weevil Anthonomus eugenii Pepper weevil larvae Adult pepper weevil Symptoms Feeding damage to foliage, buds and tender young fruit pods; larvae feed within buds and fruit; older fruit misshapen and discolored; buds and fruit may drop from plant; adult weevil is a small black beetle; larvae are small cream-white grubs with brown heads which can reach 0.6 cm (0.25 in) in length when mature. Cause Insect Comments Weevil will go through multiple generations per year; pepper preferred host but weevil will feed on other plants in the nightshade family also.Management Remove any nightshade plants growing in close proximity to pepper; immediately remove any dropped fruit from soil surface; if pepper weevil becomes problematic, rotate crop the following year; organically acceptable control methods include sprays of pyrethrin; destroy pepper crop residue immediately after harvest.
Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Chilli thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis) damaged plant Thrips infestation in a pepper blossom Symptoms If population is high leaves and buds may be distorted; leaves appear silvery and are speckled with black feces; insects will feed on and damage flowers; most damage occurs through the transmission of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV); insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color. Cause Insect Comments Insect transmits Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life.Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic.
Tomato fruit worm (Corn earworm) Helicoverpa zea Adult cornworm Mixture of larvae showing range of colors Cornworm on chilli pepper Early instar larva feeding on pepper bud Symptoms Larvae burrowing into fruit near stem end and feeding on fruit interior causing decay; fruit turn red prematurely and fall from plant causing reduced yield; young caterpillars are cream-white in color with a black head and black hairs; older larvae may be yellow-green to almost black in color with fine white lines along their body and black spots at the base of hairs; eggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are initially creamy white but develop a brown-red ring after 24 hours and darken prior to hatching. Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a pale green to tan, medium sized moth; can be one of the most damaging pests of tomato; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil; the insect is also a damaging pest of corn and is also referred to as the corn ear worm.
Management Early treatment of tomato fruitworms is necessary as once they enter the fruit they are protected from sprays; monitor About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations.
Category : Mites Spider mites (Two spotted spider mite) Tetranychus urticae Close-up view of two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) Spider mite damage on under surface of pepper leaves Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant. Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack.Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction.

Napa cabbage has a barrel shaped, elongated rosette of overlapping leaves which point inwardly and can grow 25â€“51 cm (10â€“20 in) tall, with a diameter of 15â€“20 cm (6â€“8 in).Napa cabbage may also be called Chinese leaf or wong-bok and originates from the Beijing region of China.The bok choy type cabbage is made up of about 30 individual leaves arranged into a loose, spiral head and are dark green and shiny.The petioles, or stalks, are white or light green and thick and fleshy.Bok choy can reach a height of 15â€“60 cm (0.5 to 2 ft) and spread outwards by 15â€“46 cm (0.5â€“1.5 ft).
Bok choy may also be referred to as pak choi, Chinese chard, Chinese mustard, celery mustard or spoon cabbage and also originates from China Bok-choy (subspecies chinenesis) Uses Napa cabbage and bok choy are usued in similar ways. The inner leaves of napa cabbage are eaten raw or cooked in stir fries and other dishes while the tougher outer leaves are often used in soups.Both the leaves and stems of bok choy are edible and can be eaten raw or can be cooked in stir fries and other dishes.Chinese cabbage Content Propagation Napa cabbage is a cool season annual plant and as such will grow best in temperatures averaging between 13 and 21Â°C (55â€“70Â°F), with optimum growth occurring between 15â€“18Â°C (59â€“64Â°F).Seed should be planted in the fall, 1.5 cm (0.6 in) deep in a well draining soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0.Transplants can be taken from a 4â€“5 week old plant if a spring crop is desired.
The plants can be grown on flat or raised beds and positioned in rows 50â€“60 cm (20â€“24 in) apart. Each plant should be spaced 50 cm (20 in) from its neighbor for optimum growth.Bok choy is most successfully grown in regions that experience cool summers and mild winters, growing optimally in temperatures between 15 and 20Â°C (59â€“68Â°F).Bok choy can be planted in early spring if the required climatic conditions are met, producing a crop in early summer or they can be planted in early summer for a late summer crop.The seeds will germinate quickly and seedlings are fast growing.Transplants may also be used.Seed should be sown at a depth of 15 to 20 mm (0.6â€“0.7 in) in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0 and plant should be spaced approximately 20 cm (8 in) from one another.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Brassica rapa subsp.pekinensis datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10115.[Accessed 11 November 14].Paid subscription required .

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Alternaria leaf spot (Black spot, Gray spot) Alternaria brassicae Alternaria lesions on Chinese cabbage leaf Close-up of Alternaria lesions on chinese cabbage leaf Symptoms Small dark spots on leaves which turn brown to gray; lesions may be round or angular and may possess a purple-black margin; lesions may form concentric rings, become brittle and crack in center; dark brown elongated lesions may develop on stems and petioles Cause Fungus Comments May become a problem during cool, wet periods Management Plant only pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; applications of appropriate fungicides control disease when present Anthracnose Colletotrichum higginsianum Symptoms Small circular or irregularly shaped dry spots which are gray to straw in color on leaves; a high number of spots may cause the leaf to die; lesions may coalesce to form large necrotic patches causing leaves to turn yellow and wilt; lesions may split or crack in dry centers Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters on leaf debris and on related weeds; disease emergence is favored by moist, warm conditions Management Control of disease depends on sanitary practices; treat seeds with hot water prior to planting; rotate crops; plant in an area with good soil drainage; remove all cruciferous weeds which may act as a reservoir for the fungus Black rot Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms Irregularly shaped dull yellow areas along leaf margins which expand to leaf midrib and create a characterstic "V- shaped" lesion; lesions may coalesce along the leaf margin to give plant a scorched appearance Cause Bacterium Comments Pathogen is spread via infected seed or by splashing water and insect movement; disease emergence favored by warm and humid conditions Management Primary method of controlling black rot is through the use of good sanitation practices; rotate crops to non-cruciferous crops every 2 years; plant resistant varieties; control cruciferous weed species which may act as a reservoir for bacteria; plant pathogen-free seed Clubroot Plasmodiophora brassicae Distorted roots of chinese cabbage plant caused by infection with club root fungus Symptoms Slow growing, stunted plants; yellowish leaves which wilt during day and rejuvenate in part at night; swollen, distorted roots; extensive gall formation Cause Fungus Comments Can be difficult to distinguish from nematode damage; fungus can survive in soil for periods in excess of 10 years; can be spread by movement of contaminated soil and irrigation water to uninfected areas Management Once the pathogen is present in the soil it can survive for many years, elimination of the pathogen is economicall unfeasible; rotating crops generally does not provide effective control; plant only certified seed and avoid field grown transplants unless produced in a fumigated bed; applying lime to the soil can reduce fungus sporulation Downy mildew Peronospora parasitica Symptoms of downy mildew on Chinese cabbage foliage Symptoms Irregular yellow patches on leaves which turn light brown in color; fluffy gray growth on the undersides of the leaves Cause Fungus Comments Favors cool, humid weather; damage to the cabbage head may not be seen until the cabbage is cut open Management Remove all crop debris after harvest; rotate with non-brassicas; application of appropriate fungicides may be required if symptoms of disease are present Powdery mildew Erysiphe cruciferarum Symptoms Small white patches on upper and lower leaf surfaces which may also show purple blotching; patches coalesce to form a dense powdery layer which coats the leaves; leaves become chlorotic and drop from plant Cause Fungus Comments isease emergence favored by dry season, moderate temperatures, low humidity and low levels of rainfall Management Plant resistant varieties; rotate crops; remove all crop debris after harvest; remove weeds; avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer which encourages powdery mildew growth; powdery mildew can be controled by application of sulfur sprays, dusts or vapors Watery soft rot (White mold, Cabbage drop) Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Symptoms Soft rotting area at base of stem which spreads upwards successively killing leaves by causing them to drop and infect the leaf below; when fungus reaches the head it causes a soft, slimy, watery rot Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by frequent rainfall that keep soil close to saturation Management The number of sclerotia in the soil can be reduced by plowing crop debris deep into soil and rotating crops every 3 years with non-host crops; severe infestations may require control through application of appropriate fungicide White leaf spot Mycospaerella capsellae Symptoms Small, necrotic, brown spots on leaf tips or margins that matures to light gray or white with the original dark spot in center; margins of lesions may be darker; lesions may coalesce to form large chlorotic areas and cause defoliation Cause Fungus Comments Symptoms easily confused with downy mildew; disease emergence favored by wet leaves and cool temperatures Management No known plant resistance to white leaf spot so control relies on cultural practices such as rotating crops and removing weeds; application of appropriate fungicide may help control the disease Category : Bacterial Bacterial soft rot Erwinia caratovora Symptoms Water-soaked lesions on cabbage head which expand to form a large rotted mass of cream colored tissue which is liquid underneath; surface of lesions usually crack and exude slimy liquid which turns tan, dark brown or black on exposure to air Cause Bacterium Comments Bacteria are easily spread on tools and by irrigation water; disease emergence favored by warm, moist conditions Management Chemical treatments are not available for bacterial soft rot, control relies on cultural practices; rotate crops; plant cabbage in well-draining soils or raised beds; only harvest heads when they are dry; avoid damaging heads during harvest Blackleg Leptosphaeria maculans Symptoms Damping-off of seedlings; round or irregularly shaped gray necrotic lesions on leaves with dark margins; lesions may be covered in pink masses in favorable weather conditions Cause Fungus Comments Favors warm, wet conditions; higher temperatures result in the development of more visible symptoms Management Cabbage does not have high levels of resistance to blackleg and fungicides use is uneconomical; use disease free seed or treat with hot water to remove fungus prior to planting; remove and destroy crop debris after harvest or plow deeply into soil Category : Cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicaea Symptoms Large populations can cause stunted growth or even plant death; insects may be visible on the plant leaves and are small, grey-green in color and soft bodied and are covered with a white waxy coating; prefer to feed deep down in cabbage head and may be obscured by the leaves Cause Insect Comments Cabbage aphids feed only on cruciferous plants but may survive on related weed species Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicaea Cabbage aphid colony on a cabbage leaf Symptoms Large populations can cause stunted growth or even plant death; insects may be visible on the plant leaves and are small, grey-green in color and soft bodied and are covered with a white waxy coating; prefer to feed deep down in cabbage head and may be obscured by the leaves Cause Insect Comments Cabbage aphids feed only on cruciferous plants but may survive on related weed species Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Category : Fungal, Oomycete Damping-off Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Death of seedlings after germination; brown or black rot girdling stem; seedling may remain upright but stem is constricted and twisted (wirestem); in older cabbage plants sharply defined brown lesions appear on the underside of leaves; the lesions expand causing leaves to wilt and drop from plant Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence in seedlings favored by cool temperatures Management Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants that have been produced in sterilized soil; apply fungicide to seed to kill off any fungi; shallow plant seeds or delay planting until soil warms Pests Category : Insects Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Young larvae Beet armyworm eggs covered in white hairs Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling the beet armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper and damage Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm feeding on plant stem Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Cutworm larva severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella Diamondback moth pupae Larva feeding on cabbage leaf Symptoms Young larvae feed between upper and lower leaf surface and may be visible when they emerge from small holes on the underside of the leaf; older larvae leave large, irregularly shaped shotholes on leaf undersides, may leave the upper surface intact; larvae may drop from the plant on silk threads if the leaf is disturbed; larvae are small (1 cm/0.3 in) and tapered at both ends; larvae have to prolegs at the rear end that are arranged in a distinctive V-shape Cause Insect Comments Larvae take between 10 and 14 days to mature and spin a loose, gauze-like cocoon on leaves or stems to pupate Management Larvae can be controlled organically by applications of Bacillus thurengiensis or Entrust; application of appropriate chemical insecticide is only necessary if larvae are damaging the growing tips of the plants Large cabbage white (Cabbageworm) Pieres rapae Cabbageworm and frass on a cabbage leaf Symptoms Large ragged holes in leaves or bored into head; green-brown frass (insect feces) on leaves; caterpillar is green in color and hairy, with a velvet-like appearance; may have faint yellow to orange stripes down back; slow-moving compared with other caterpillars Cause Insect Comments Butterfly larvae cause damage by feeding on plants; can be distinguished from other caterpillars by its sluggish movement; in large numbers larvae can cause extensive damage very quickly Management Hand-pick caterpillars from plants and destroy; scrape eggs from leaves prior to hatching; apply appropriate insecticide if infestation is very heavy Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Category : Mites Flea beetle Phyllotreta spp.
Flea beetle damage on Chinese cabbage Severe damage to Chinese cabbage leaf by flea beetles Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insect Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Chives, Allium schoenoprasum , are perennial herbs in the family Liliaceae grown for their leaves which are used as culinary herbs.
The chive plant is a member of the onion family and forms small bulbs from the roots. The leaves of the plant are tapering, hollow and cylindrical and have a soft texture.The chive plant grows in clumps and produces large pale purple flowers in a dense clusters of 10â€“30 individual inflorescences.Chives grow to approximately 46 cm (18 in) in height and can live for many years in favorable conditions.The exact origin of the chive plant is disputed but it grows wild in Europe, Australia and North America.Chive flowers Flower heads beginning to open Chive flower heads Chives Chive plant Chive plant Uses Chives are consumed fresh as a culinary herb in a variety of dishes.Chives Content Propagation Basic requirements Chives are easy to grow and tolerate a range of soil types and conditions.Chives will grow best in a well-draining soil, rich in organic matter with a pH of 6-7 and will perform optimally when positioned in full sunlight but will tolerate partial shade.
Propagation Starting from seeds Chives can be grown directly from seed or new plants can be produced by dividing an established plant. Seeds can be started indoors approximately 4 weeks prior to the last frost date and should be planted in flat trays containing sterile seed starting mix.Plant seeds to a depth of 1.3 cm (0.5 in).The seeds are slow to germinate, emerging after about 7 days but the seedlings develop quickly and are ready to be transplanted when they are about 4 weeks old and after they have been hardened.Dividing plants Established plants should be divided in the Spring.Start by watering the plants a few hours before dividing to soften the soil and ensure the plants are turgid.Identify individual groups of plants and plant to take 3 to 4 of these together to form a new clump.Cut the chives back to a height of approximately 10 cm (4 in) and carefully extract the existing plant from the soil.
Break the clump by dropping the plant from a gentle height to break it apart into separate plants. Transplanting Individual plants or seedlings should be planted 20 to 30 cm (8-12 in) apart.Plant divided plants about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) deeper than they were previously.Keep the plants moist to aid in the establishment of the root system.Harvesting Chives can be harvested at any time once plants are established.To harvest leaves simply snip them with a pair of scissors leaving about 3 cm (2 in) of green on the plant.Begin harvesting from the outside leaves inwards as required.The plants will quickly produce new growth.General care and maintenance Chives benefit from the application of a layer of mulch in the Spring, grass clipping or leaves are ideal and help to conserve soil moisture and suppress weeds.When plants flower, remove the flower head when it starts to dry out and die in order to divert energy to the production of leaves.
Chives require the application of fertilizer at regular intervals throughout the growing season unless they were planted in composted manure. A liquid fertilizer should be applied every 4 to 6 weeks.References Anderson, C.R.Home Gardening Series.Chives.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-6082.pdf.[Accessed 11 November 14].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Allium schoenoprasum datasheet.http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/4251.[Accessed 11 November 14].Paid subscription required .Drost, D.(2010).Chives in the Garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/HG_2004-01.pdf.[Accessed 11 November 14].Free to access .MacKenzie, J.(2007).Chives.University of Minnesota Extension.Available at: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/chives/index.html.[Accessed 11 November 14].Free to access .Schwartz, H.F.& Mohan, S.K.

Oil extracted from the bark and leaves is used as a flavoring or scent in perfumes.Propagation Basic requirements Cinnamon is a tropical plant and grows best in warm areas with high humidity where average temperatures reach approximately 27Â°C (80.6Â°F).Cinnamon can be grown in a wide range of soils but the highest quality bark is obtained when trees are grown in sandy soils rich in humus.Cinnamon grows best when planted in full sun but as a forest tree it will tolerate some shading.Trees require an average annual rainfall of between 1250 and 2500 mm.
Propagation Cinnamon can be grown from seed or vegetatively propagated. Fruits often have to be bagged in order to save the seeds as they are often consumed by birds.Planting material should be selected from trees showing the desired bark characteristics which are healthy and vigorous regardless of the propagation method used.Cinnamon trees are usually cultivated commercially through cutting or by air layering due to the seeds exhibiting a wide genetic variability.Propagation from seed Seeds should be collected from the pulp of the fruit, washed and dried.Seeds should be planted as soon as possible after extraction as they do not remain viable for long.Seeds should be planted in prepared nursery beds or in polyethylene bags filled with good quality potting soil or aged compost or composted manure.The seedbed or bags should be provided with shading to protect the seedlings and seeds should be kept moist with frequent irrigation.Germination usually occurs after approximately 20 days.
Seedlings can be transplanted to the field after about 3 months. Vegetative propagation Cinnamon can be propagated vegetatively from cuttings, by layering or by dividing the root ball.A cutting is usually taken by removing a partially mature shoot with at least one node from an established mother plant.The shoot should then be planted in a polyethylene bag to establish its own root system, thus creating a new tree.Cuttings are usually grown under the protection of a polyethylene covering which is removed gradually to harden the seedlings for field planting.Seedling are ready to be transplanted to the field when they are 12 to 18 months old.Transplanting Seedlings should be planted in a pre-dug hole large enough to accommodate the root ball and backfilled with topsoil.Adding rock phosphate to the planting hole aids in root development.Trees are often grown in small groups to produce a single clump or are planted individually.
For commercial production, field spacings of between 0.9 m (3 ft) to 1.2 m (4 ft) per tree are recommended.

Areas that undergo a dry season are good for flowering but the tree must be planted in an area with deep, fertile soil to limit water stress. Clove trees grow optimally at temperatures between 16 and 27Â°C (65â€“80Â°F) in rich loamy, well draining soil.Propagation Clove is commercially propagated from seeds which are planted soon after harvest.Seeds should be collected and extracted from the fruits of healthy mother plants exhibiting desirable characteristics.The seeds are extracted by soaking the fruits in water and peeling the skin from the fruit.The seeds can be planted in prepared nursery beds or polyethylene bags containing a mixture of soil and aged manure and should be planted to a depth of 2 to 5 cm (0.8-2.0 in) and spaced 12 to 15 cm (4.7-5.9 in) apart.Germination usually occurs within 1 to 6 weeks.The seedlings should be shaded to protect them from harsh sunlight.
The seedlings should be kept moist through regular watering and can be transplanted when they reach at least 30 cm (11.8 in) in height. The seedlings should be hardened off by exposing them to increasing amounts of sunlight before the are transplanted to the field.Transplanting Young clove trees should be planted in pre-dug pits which are approximately 60 Ã— 60 Ã—60 cm (24 Ã— 24 Ã— 24 in), or large enough to accommodate the root ball.The recommended spacing for clove trees is 8 m (26 ft) but closer spacings are commonly used.Trees planted in the field should be provided with temporary shading to alleviate stress.Shade can be provided through intercropping with other crops such as banana, cassava or coconut but trees such as Gliricidia are also used as these can be pruned to alter the amount of light reaching the cloves throughout the year.
General care and maintenance Once the temporary shade plants are removed, the plantation should be kept free from weeds by weeding once or twice each year or by applying a layer of mulch around the trees. Mulch helps prevent the roots being damaged by the physical removal of the weeds.Trees may require additional irrigation during dry periods to prevent them becoming stressed which harms their production.The trees should also be provided with nutrients in the form of fertilizer or manure.The composition and amount of fertilizer required is dependent on the region and soil type.Harvesting The complete inflorescence (flower) should be picked just before the first buds open to ensure maximum size and oil content of the buds.The harvest is often conducted over 3 to 8 pickings during the season as buds mature.After harvesting, the buds are laid out to dry in the sun for several days.

Several species are cultivated specifically for fodder.
The most commonly cultivated is white clover, Trifolium repens . Clover species are generally small and are usually trifoliate (leaves possess three leaflets) although some species possess five or seven leaflets.The clover plant has smooth stems and produces small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers made up up many florets.Clover species can be can be annual, biennial or short-lived perennials.White clover may live for 3â€“5 years, and can reach a height of 20â€“30 cm (8â€“12 inches).Clover may also be referred to as Ladino clover, Dutch clover or trefoil and it originates from Europe.Clover flower being visited by a honey bee Clover leaflets White clover flowers Clover flowering White clover Clover leaflet Uses Clover is mainly cultivated to provide pasture or to protect soil.It may be harvested and used as forage, hay or silage.Clover Content Propagation Basic requirements White clover is the most widely grown clover in the world, growing best in a cool, moist, temperate climate.
It can be grown on a wide range of soils but performs best in well-draining clay or loam as opposed to sandy soils. The plant will grow optimally at a soil pH of 5.5 and 7.0.Dry soils are not recommended due to the shallow root system.Clover tolerates shade, repeated mowing and field traffic very well making it well suited to use as a cover crop.Planting Clover is direct seeded either by drilling or broadcasting.When growing clover as a commercial crop, a higher yield will be obtained in warmer areas if the seed is inoculated with Rhizobacteria before planting.Inoculation is not necessary if an inoculated clover crop was grown in the same field within the past 3 years or in colder regions where nitrogen-fixing bacteria can persist in the soil.If broadcasting seed, spread 5â€“14 lb (2.25â€“6.35 kg) of seed per acre and cover.When drilling seed, 3â€“9 lb (1.4â€“4 kg) of pure seed should be planted per acre to a depth of 6â€“12 mm (1/4 â€“ 1/2 in).
Clover is also commonly sown into an existing grass pasture or with grass seed to establish a mixed pasture. Seeding rates into an existing grass pasture should be 2â€“4 lb (0.9â€“1.8 kg) per acre.The soil should be kept moist after seeding to promote germination.General care and maintenance If grown as a forage crop mixed with grass, management should be aimed at maintaining clover at 40 to 50% of the total cover.Grazing to a stubble height of 5 cm (2 in) favors the growth of the clover, whereas lighter grazing will favor the growth of grass.The pasture should be fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorous depending on the needs of the particular soil.When grown as a living mulch, clover should be mowed as required and killed off when no longer needed.Clover can be killed by rototilling, undercutting or moldboard plowing.White clover can be persistent and it is necessary to kill off the root system to effectively kill the plants.Clover seeds References Clark, Andy (ed.).2007.

Description Cocoa Scientific name: Theobroma cacao Rank: Species Higher classification: Theobroma Family: Malvaceae Kingdom: Plantae Order: Malvales Local Names English (Mother of cocoa, Mexican lilac, quikstick) Cocoa may also be referred to as cacao, koko or Kacao and originates from upper Amazon region of South America. General information.Cocoa is an evergreen tree in the Malvaceae family that is grown for its seeds (beans), which are primarily used in the production of chocolate.Cocoa (cacao) Content AÂ cocoa tree is a branching tree with simple, pointed (lanceolate) leaves that can reach up toÂ 10Â cmÂ in width and 61 cm inÂ length.The tree bears clusters of pale-yellow flowers with five petals and sepals each.Cocoa pods (drupes) can be green- white, yellow, purplish, or red in color, with 20-50 seeds arranged in five distinct rows.How do cocoa fruits look?The ripe cocoa fruits are yellow, greenish, yellow-red, and red to red-brown.
They have the shape of American football balls. They grow to be about 25 cm long and have a thick shell.In the center is a white, sweet pulp with 25 to 50 seeds arranged in five rows.Each one is about 2-3 cm long.They are encased in white mucus.Criollo cocoa fruit.We have three main varieties of cocoa: -Criollo.-Forastero.-Trinitario.i).Criollo Criollo is a noble and extremely rare group of many varieties.It now accounts for less than 1% of global production, despite dominating 200 years ago.It is indigenous to Colombia and Venezuela.It is also grown commercially in Peru, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Madagascar, and the Caribbean region.Types of Cocoa Criollo example from Venezuela Criollo guasare It is grown south of Lake Maracaibo.Its plantations are currently quite small.It is distinguished by a green fruit with a thin, slightly rough shell.This is a high-quality cocoa.
Criollo chuao Its among the most famous type cocoa grown in the world, it is mainly grown in the Chuao region of Aragua state. It is classed as fine cocoa.Criollo porcelain It is grown in the southern regions of Lake Maracaibo.It has a distinct flavor and is considered extremely fine cocoa by experts.It is thought to have the highest genetic quality of all Venezuelan cocoa trees.ii).Forastero Forastero is native to the Amazon basin, which is why it is also known as Cacao Amazonico.Because of its high yield, this cocoa is also known as Cacao Corriente or ordinary cocoa.It is currently grown in many regions, primarily in Africa (Ghana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire).The Spaniards first brought this cocoa from Venezuela.Â According to various sources, it accounts for 85-95% of global production.The relatively low requirements and ease of cultivation account for such a large share.It is relatively resistant to diseases and pests.It grows faster and produces more than the other groups.
The appearance of individual Forastero varieties varies. There are numerous subspecies, including Cundeamor, Calabacillo and Amelonado.iii).Trinitario Trinitario cocoa has a delicate flavor.It is a cross between the two varieties mentioned above.It was chosen during the seventeenth century.The trees were brought to Trinidad from Venezuela.It was a big hit.Trinidad produced the best cocoa beans for several decades.Trinitario's global market share is currently less than 10%.The aroma of Trinitario is forastero, and the flavor is delicate criollo.Red cocoa pods Cocoa flower Red cocoa pods Ripe cocoa pod Cocoa pods Cocoa tree and pods Uses Cocoa seeds have a high fat content and thus provide an energy-rich and delicious food.Cocoa is grown in all humid andÂ tropical countries.CÃ´te d'Ivoire (the world's largest cocoa producer) is the leading cocoa producer in Africa, followed by Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.
Chocolate, cocoa powder, and butterfat are the main products made from cocoa beans whichÂ are all consumed by humans. Butterfat is also used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, but the amount used is insignificant in comparison to that used in chocolate production.Raw cocoa (dried cocoa seeds) is the most sought-after product on the international market, and it is used to make cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and chocolate.Dried and fermented cocoa beans Cocoa beans in a cacao pod Climatic condition soil and water.Cocoa grows in the so-called under-storey of primary forests and is associated with a number of palm species as well as a number of other tree species.For example, in rain forests, tree varieties from the upper storey, primarily single trees overtopping the forest canopy, lose their foliage during the months of shorter daylight hours.The increased light encourages the development of cocoa blossoms, and the falling leaves provide organic material enrichment.
The plantations can survive on 1250 mm of rainfall per year if the annual distribution is even (100 mm per month). Heavy clouds and high humidity can compensate for short drought periods.The annual average temperature should be around 25Â° C.Harvesting periods are reduced to a few months per year in regions with extensive wet periods or large seasonal temperature fluctuations.Cocoa produces fruit almost all year in regions with a balanced climate and only minor temperature and rainfall fluctuations.As a result, cocoa is a typical crop of the tropical lowlands.If other conditions are favorable, it can also be grown at higher altitudes.Cocoa has shown to develop more quickly in areas without a dry season than in the major production areas of West Africa, where growth is slowed by drought during certain months of the year.Cocoa plantations should have deep, well-drained soil with adequate water retention.
Soils with a high available moisture- storage capacity can compensate for lack of rain. The pH of the solution should be between 4.0 and 7.5.It is critical to ensure that there is enough organic material available.Cocoa trees can live for more than a century.Naturally occurring cocoa crops reproduce through lateral shoots that can appear at any height on the trunk.Natural vegetative proliferation occurs when small rodents and apes spread the seeds.Propagation and planting The natural site requirements of cocoa should be followed when selecting a location for a new plantation.Sites with alluvial soils that are resistant to waterlogging are ideal.Other appropriate locations include irrigated form wells and hollows.Steep and convex slopes are unsuitable locations.When establishing a new plantation, take care to replicate the natural structure of forests as closely as possible.
This means that in the agroecosystem, all of the varieties that will be cultivated alongside cocoa should be planted at the same time (or even before) the cocoa. The best method is to leave an area open for natural growth and plant tall-growing trees that will quickly provide cover, such as bananas and manioc, and then plant cocoa in between them later.The biological activity of the soil is maintained in this manner, and the cocoa mycorrhiza can begin to develop immediately.Cocoa is typically planted as seedlings, which are simple and inexpensive to produce.To establish seed gardens, vegetative propagation via rooted cuttings or budding is used.In a shaded nursery, seedlings are typically raised in polythene bags.At the age of 4 - 6 months, young plants are planted in the field 3 - 4 m apart.Young trees require shade to reduce irradiance, buffer the microenvironment, and promote proper tree shape and habit.The need for shade is reduced when a closed canopy is formed.
Cocoa can only be grown without shade under the most favorable soil and nutrient conditions. In order to extend the economic life of plantations, some shade is usually required to reduce moisture stress and the incidence of insect damage.Shade can be obtained by either thinning the forest or planting shade trees.Shade trees are common in South-East Asia, where they are mostly seedless and Mother of cocoa.Hedges of leguminous shrubs are frequently used for temporary side protection between rows as well as a source of mulch.Cocoa can also be grown as an intercrop with coconuts.Main varieties grown are Trinitario -This variety is a hybrid of Criollo and Forastero.-The pods can be long or short, and red or yellow.-It produces reasonably high-quality cocoa.Forastero (Amelonado) (Amelonado) -The pods are short, yellow, smooth, and have shallow furrows.-This variety yields well, but the quality is not as high as that of Criollo.It is widely grown in Africa.
Criollo -When Criollo pods are ripe, they are long, yellow or red, with deep furrows and large warts. -This variety does not produce as much as the others, but the cocoa is of very high quality.-It is mostly grown in the United States.Harvesting The most vital characteristics of cocoa are dependent on proper processing, which begins with harvesting and ends with storage.Pod development takes about 6 months from seed to maturity.When the pods are completely ripe, harvesting can begin.An orange discoloration of the shell distinguishes many Trinitario types with their red and dark violet pods.When other varieties are ripe, they turn yellow.Depending on the region and weather conditions, there are usually one or two harvesting phases that last several months.It is best to harvest all of the ripened pods every 2-3 weeks to ensure uniform ripeness of the harvested pods.Each week during peak production, pods are harvested.
To avoid damaging ofÂ the bark, use a sharp knife or other suitable instrument to cut off the pods at the base of the blossom. POST-HARVEST PROCESSES After harvest, the cocoa fruit is fermented, dried, and stored.Farmers remain vulnerable to production losses during these processes and the quality and flavor of the product is defined by the environment and the methods used.Fermentation There are various ways in which farmers can engage in the process of cocoa fermentation.After the cocoa beans and pulp are removed from the husk, smallholders typically cover the heaps of cocoa with plantain or banana leaves and let them ferment for approximately five days.This traditional approach to fermentation, however, is susceptible to environmental risk factors.Periods of intense rainfall increase the time required for fermentation.Temperature changes, droughts, and prolonged dry seasons affect the flavor and overall quality of the product.
Unlike farmers in West Africa, cocoa farmers in Latin America tend to ferment the cocoa pulp surrounding the beans using wooden boxes. In Indonesia, farmers rarely take part in the fermentation process because their production is valued mostly for cocoa butter which is unaffected by fermentation.Drying The next step after fermentation is the drying of the cocoa beans.Under inadequate methods and circumstances, drying can result in production losses and loss of quality.Farmers may either sun dry their beans or use an artificial drying technique.The former is common in countries that have a significant dry period during which to carry out drying and it involves placing the cocoa seeds on a surface exposed to the sun either on mats, trays, or concrete.Artificial drying involves the use of an artificial source of heat such as fires.Intensive rainfall can cause molding of cocoa beans and reduce quality.
While temperature changes alter the time required for drying, droughts and dry periods will increase the speed at which cocoa dries. CSC recommends the use of solar dryers, which are easy to build using wood and clear plastic.Solar dryers avoid the GHG emissions of artificial drying and protect cocoa from excessive humidity.Storage In temperate climates, cocoa can be safely stored for years.High temperatures and humidity, on the other hand, cause a rapid infestation of storage pests and infection with mould fungi in the moist tropics.Because cocoa is highly hygroscopic, even a well-dried product can increase in moisture content by up to 10% in areas with 80-90% humidity, reducing its storage capacity.For storage, the critical moisture content is 8%.Cocoa should be stored in air-permeable sacks for a short period of time on the production site, and the sacks should be stacked on wooden planks or boards.
Sacks made of organic material that have been treated with pesticides should be avoided since the cocoa butter component of the cocoa shell is an excellent solvent for chlorinated hydrocarbons, which can diffuse through the outer shell and into the cocoa seed when they come into contact with it. In such cases, tests have revealed that limits for certain agricultural poisons were exceeded despite the fact that no pesticides had ever been used on the site.The storage area should be well-ventilated at all times, with the inside temperature remaining below the outside temperature.It is common practice on conventional plantations to gas the cocoa with methyl bromide to protect it from storage pests.However, the use of methyl bromide is no longer permitted.Tetraline soap, hydrogen phosphide, and prussic acid are also employed.It is not permitted to use insecticides against storage pests or to gas the beans on organic cocoa plantations.

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Oomycete Black pod (Phytophthora pod rot) Phytophthora palmivora Phytophthora megakarya Phytophthora capsici Pods of Theobroma cacao in central Costa Rica display symptoms of the fungal disease black pod. This disease causes pods to rot on the cacao tree during the last stages of ripening.Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms of black pod of cocoa Symptoms Translucent spots on pod surface which develop into a small, dark hard spots; entire pod becomes black and necrotic with 14 days of initial symptoms; white to yellow downy growth on black areas; internal tissues become dry and shriveled resulting in mummified pods Cause Oomycete Comments Disease occurs in all cocoa growing areas; P.megakarya is most destructive in Central and West Africa whereas P.
capsici is most common in Central and South America Management Protective sprays of copper containing fungicides in combination with systemic fungicides are often recommended to control the disease; cocoa plants should be well spaced to allow good air circulation through the plantation; mummified pods should be removed and destroyed to reduce spread Category : Viral Cocoa swollen shoot Cocoa swollen shoot virus (CSSV) Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) showing swollen shoot diseased stem. Symptoms of swollen shoot of cocoa Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus symptoms Symptoms of swollen shoot of cocoa Symptoms Swelling of leaves and shoots; red leaf veins, notably in young leaves; chlorotic patches next to leaf veins; chlorotic spots or flecks on leaves mottled, smooth pods with reduced beans; mottled coloration on pods; stems may develop swellings at nodes or internodes and shoot tips; progressive defoliation may occur ultimately leading to the death of the tree.
Cause Virus Comments Only occurs in West Africa. Major problem in Togo, Ghana, Cote d'Ivorie and Nigeria; transmitted by mealybugs.The Swollen Shoot Virus is not native to cocoa but jumped into the cocoa from trees that grew in the rain forests of W.Africa (e.g.Cola chlamydanta, Ceiba pentandra, Adansonia digitata, Cola gigantean and Sterculia tragacantha).The virus is a badnavirus within the family Caulimoviridae.Management Infected trees and those surrounding them should be removed and destroyed (up to 5 m from infected tree if less than 10 trees are infected and up to a distance of 15 m if greater than 100 trees are infected) to prevent further spread; a gap should be placed between cocoa plantations of at least 10 m (33 ft) and it may be possible to isolate cocoa plantations using a non-host crop such as oil palm growing between plantations.

Cause Fungus Comments Causes serious losses in South-Western parts of South America; spores are dry and powdery and are spread easily by water movement, wind or movement of pods; disease spread is highest during periods of high rainfall.
Management Planting cocoa varieties that produce pods during the dry season allows the pod to avoid the disease; pods showing symptoms of disease should be removed to prevent spread; application of copper containing fungicides will help reduce disease incidence. Witches' broom Moniliophthora perniciosa Spores released from the fan- shaped basidiocarp of this inch-wide Crinipellis perniciosa mushroom can infect cacao trees and drastically reduce yields of the beans from which cocoa and chocolate products are made.A branch of a cacao tree in western Ecuador killed by witchesâ€™ broom disease.Protruding from some leaf midveins are whitish fungal structures that send thousands of spores onto other trees.Pathogenic fungi that cause witches' broom on cacao tree limbs and trunks also attack pods, destroying the valuable beans inside.
Symptoms Characteristic proliferation of shoots and brooms from bud; production of branches which do not produce fruit; distorted pods with green patches which give an appearance of uneven ripening. Cause Fungus Comments One of the most devastating cocoa diseases in South America; disease is widespread throughout South America, the Caribbean and Panama; spread of disease greatly influenced by humidity with emergence favored by high temperature and high humidity (>80%).Management Good sanitation is the most effective method of controlling the disease; material known to be infected should be removed and destroyed; removal of infected material can be difficult as there may be no visible symptoms; new fungicides and resistant cocoa varieties are being developed to help control the disease.Pests Category : Insects Cocoa mealybugs Planococcus spp.Pseudococus spp.
Cocoa mealybugs being tended by ants Symptoms Flattened oval to round disc-like insect covered in waxy substance on tree branches; insects attract ants which may also be present; insect colony may also be associated with growth of sooty mold due to fungal colonization of sugary honeydew excreted by the insect; symptoms of directinsect damage not well documented but trees may exhibit symptoms of cocoa swollen shoot (see disease entry) Cause Insect Comments Insects have a wide host range; often tended by ants which farm them for their sugary honeydew secretions; transmit Cocoa swollen shoot virus Management Mealybugs can potentially be controlled by natural enemies such as lady beetles but are commonly controlled using chemicals; chemical pesticides may also decrease populations of natural enemies leading to mealybug outbreaks Cocoa mirid Distantiella theobroma Sahlbergella singularis Helopeltis spp. Monalonion spp.The picture shows pods attacked by Helopeltis pest.Helopeltis sp.
(cocoa mirid) Cocoa mirid feeding on cocoa pod Cocoa mirid and damage to pod Comparison between healthy pods and ones attacked by cocoa mirid. Symptoms First symptoms appear as tiny puncture wounds on young stems and pods; these punctures quickly turn necrotic, creating black patches which may develop into cankers; discolored bark; terminal leaves and branches dying back; trees unproductive; adult insect is a slender red or brown insect with long legs and antennae; adults are typically between 7 and 10 mm long.Cause Insect Comments Adult females lay their eggs in the bark of the tree and can lay between 30 and 40 eggs.
Management In African countries, the insect is usually controlled by chemical eradication programs consisting of two sprays conducted one month apart to target different stages of the insects development; mirids have been shown to be attracted to trees positioned in direct sunlight and providing shade cover in the form of forest to cocoa trees can be used as part of an integrated control method; do not interplant with other hosts such as cashew, tea, sweet potato, guava, cotton or mango - the trees used must be non-hosts; some species of ant, e.g black ants, can be used as a biological control agent.
Cocoa pod borer Conopomorpha cramerella Symptoms Holes in cocoa pod husk caused by insect larvae entering and exiting the pod; uneven and premature ripening of pods; seeds sticking together inside pod due to insect eating surrounding tissue; harvested cocoa beans clump together and can be very difficult to remove from the pod; adult insect is a small brown moth; larvae are cream in color and approximately 1 cm (0.4 in) long; larvae change color to green when they emerge from the pod to pupate. Cause Insect Comments Female moth lives for approximately 5-7 days and can lay 100-200 eggs; eggs are laid on the surface of cocoa pods; larvae develop for 14-18 days before pupating.
Management Sleeving pods in plastic bags while they mature prevents the insect from reaching the pods, sleeves should be applied when pods are 8-10 cm (3-4 in) long; borer populations can be held in check by black ants and weaver ants; chemical control is often economically unfeasible due to the high price of pesticides compared with the low price of cocoa but, About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms where available, small amounts of contact pyrethroid or carbamate applied to underside of cocoa leaves can keep borers below an economically damaging level.

The coconut palm has an erect or slightly curved stem which grows from a swollen base.The stem is smooth, light gray in color and has prominent leaf scars.The stem is topped with a crown of 60â€“70 spirally arranged leaves.The leaves are long (up to 7 m/23 ft), pinnately divided and composed of 200â€“250 tapering leaflets.The inflorescence is a spike produced at the leaf axil with 20â€“60 branches, each with a female flower at the base and many male flowers.The fruit is a drupe containing a single seed.
It is ovoid in shape with three sides divided by ridges. The exocarp and the mesocarp make up the husk of the coconut.The seed is protected by a thick, stony shell, or endocarp, and is partially filled with a liquid known as coconut water.The edible endosperm is white and meaty and can be between 1.0 and 2.5 cm (0.4â€“1.0 in) thick.Coconut palms can reach a height of 30 m (98 ft), produce up to 75 fruits a year, and live for up to 90 years.The origin of the coconut is unknown although the center of genetic diversity lies in Southeast Asia.
Coconut Content Coconut propagation Harvested coconut drupes Coconut seed cut open to reveal flesh Coconut inflorescence Coconut drupes Coconut seedling Close-up image of coconut palm leaf Coconut palms can reach 30 m (98 ft) Coconut palms with coconuts climatic conditions, soil and water management Coconut needs a continuous supply of water, which can be provided by regular rainfall of about 1250 mm per annum, or from ground water (at a depth of 1-3 m). It can not tolerate water logging.The northern Kenya coast receives only a rainfall of 750-1000 mm and this restricts production.Coconut grows best at average temperatures of around 26-27Â°C.Because of its temperature requirements, the coconut palm cannot normally grow above 750 m.However, near to the equator and in areas where other conditions are favourable for coconut development, it is possible to grow the crop up to about 1300 m.Growth is stimulated by a sufficient supply of chlorine in the soil.
The coconut palm can withstand up to 1% salt in the soil. These conditions are generally found in tropical and subtropical coastal regions with little rainfall.Coconut palms can also grow on deep, water-logging free, alluvial soil, away from the coast - yet low chlorine content in the soil could have negative effects.Consider these conditions when choosing a site.Depending on the site, coconut palms can be cultivated on agroforestry systems.As a plant of the upper storey, with essential light requirements, the coconut palm towers above such crops as citrus, cacao and others coconut varieties West Coast Tall Coconut This tall coconut tree bears fruit in 6-7 years and produces around 60-80 coconuts per palm, each year.It is drought-tolerant, and the color of the fruits varies from green to yellow and orange to brown.The East Coast tall coconut East coast tall produces around 60-70 coconuts on each palm every year and takes 6-8 years to yield fruits.
This tall coconut tree needs well-drained, loamy soil to thrive. Maypan Coconut Hybrid of Malayan and Panama; Maypan is a cold-hardy variety, producing medium to large-sized coconuts.Growing up to 20-meters, this variety is also resistant to lethal yellowing disease..Tiptur Tall Coconut Leathery fronds of tiptur tree produce 6-12 inches long fruits.It starts bearing fruits in 6-7 years from the planting and produces 70-80 coconuts on each palm, every year.It is one of the best coconut tree variety to grow.Orange Dwarf Coconut Producing fruits in 3-4 years, this dwarf variety can yield around 50-70 drupes per palm each year.Each crown of this tree consists of 20-28 leaves.Avoid growing this palm tree in the wind prone areas, as it may get damaged due to strong winds.Green Dwarf Coconut This palm tree yields around 60-70 coconuts per palm and begins fruiting in 3-4 years.Its drupes are dark green and resistant to root wilt disease.
Malayan Yellow Dwarf Coconut This palm has a yield of 50-60 coconuts on each palm per year and starts bearing fruits after 3-4 years. It is native to Indonesia and is resistant to lethal yellowing disease.Fiji Dwarf Coconut This tropical ornamental tree is popular for its long fronds and a swollen trunk base.Its unique leaf arrangement makes it different from others and has a large bulb at its lower stem.Thanks to its durable nature, it has earned the name- Tough nut.Other coconut varieties include, VHCI coconut, Macapuno coconut and King coconut Uses Coconuts are primarily cultivated for their oil.The oil is extracted from the endosperm and is used in cooking.Low grade oils are used in the production of soaps.The endosperm can be consumed fresh or dry and is commonly grated for use in baking.Young coconuts, termed waternuts, are commonly sold in tropical resorts, where the liquid is drunk directly from the shell.
Coconuts may also be used to produce coconut milk by squeezing the liquid from the grated endosperm. Coconut milk is popularly used in many dishes from Southeast Asia.

It grows optimally in areas with an annual mean temperature of 27Â°C (80.6Â°F) with in excess of 2000 hours of sunlight per year. The palm will thrive in a wide range of soils from sand to clay as long as they are well draining and well aerated with a pH between 4.3 and 8.0.Although palms are often found growing on sandy beaches, they can be successfully grown inland but will not tolerate freezing temperatures.Propagation Coconut palms are propagated exclusively from seed.The seeds are ready for planting when the coconut milk can be heard sloshing around inside the seed when it is shaken.Seeds are germinated by planting in seed beds before transferring to a polythene bag or nursery beds after germination.Seeds should be planted on their sides in a shallow hole with enough soil to cover about one third of the seed.The seed should be watered regularly to prevent it drying out.Germination usually occurs after about 3 months but may take up to 6 months.
Transplanting Coconut seedling can be transplanted from 6 months onwards or transferred to pots and grown further in the nursery. Trees require a wide spacing and are typically planted 8â€“9 m (26â€“30 ft) apart allowing a further 8â€“9 m (26â€“30 ft) between rows.Dwarf varieties can be spaced closer together and are typically planted 7.5 m (25 ft) apart allowing another 7.5 m (25 ft) between rows Crop monitoring The nuts ripen during the entire year.As a rule, a harvest is carried out every 1-2 months, when the ripened coconuts are harvested directly from the tree - farmers should not wait until the nuts fall from the tree.The nuts are fully ripened when the coconut water can be clearly heard sloshing against the inside when they are shaken.Harvesting too early can unfavorably affect the quality of the copra.Harvesting Stock plants that are suitable seed providers produce 100 nuts per year and up to 180 g copra per nut.In drier areas yields are usually 15-20 nuts/tree/year.
Harvest fully-ripened nuts intended to provide seeds after 11-12 months. Cut down nuts and lower them carefully (e.g.by rope).Do not allow the nuts to fall down.Following the harvest, store nuts for a short break in a covered, well- ventilated place.drying Sun drying Remove the husk first.Dry nuts on a clean surface to reduce moisture from 45% to 6%.In fine weather this takes about 5 days.Turn the pieces occasionally and cover them at night and in rainy weather.Kiln drying Make a fire in the pit of the kiln.Use the coconut shells as fuel as they heat well and smoke little.Put the copra on a wire mesh platform over the fire and protect it from the rain.This takes about 4 days.References Broschat, T.K.& Crane, J.H.(2011).The Coconut Palm in Florida.University of Florida IFAS Extension.Available at: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG04300.pdf.[Accessed 13 November 14].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Cocos nucifera datasheet.

Cause Oomycete Comments Palms between 14 and 40 years old most susceptible; disease occurs in all coconut growing regions; diseases emergence favored by high rainfall.Management Control of the disease is reliant on good sanitation practices and the use of appropriate systemic fungicides; remove all infected debris and dead trees from plantation and destroy; irrigate trees early in the day to allow surfaces to dry off during the day.Ganoderma butt rot Ganoderma spp.
Fruiting bodies Close-up of Ganoderma root and butt rot fruiting bodies Ganoderma root and butt rot (Ganoderma australe) fruiting bodies Symptoms Older fronds turning yellow and gradually wilting and drooping; fronds collapsing and dying; internal tissue of lower stem discolored; overall reduction in vigor. Cause Fungi Comments Fungi may enter through wounds on trunk or pruning wounds.Management Spacing trees widely limits the chance of infection through root grafts; avoid damaging tree trunks with tools and machinery; remove any dead or severely damaged trees from plantation immediately, including any that have been killed by natural processes; if a site is known to be infected with the disease, the ground should be fallowed for at least 1 year prior to a new plantation being established.
Gray leaf blight Pestalotiopsis palmarum Symptom Pestalotiopsis leaf spot (Pestalotiopsis palm arum) sign Symptoms Small, yellow-brown spots on leaflets which develop gray centers and dark green borders; lesions coalesce to form large necrotic patches; tips of leaflets turning gray; canopy has blighted appearance. Cause Fungus Comments Fungi will colonize young, wounded or weakened tissues; disease emergence favored by high rainfall and high humidity.Management Disease usually only merits control in coconut nurseries as infection of mature coconut palms are rare; appropriate broad spectrum protective fungicides should be applied.
Lethal bole rot Marasmiellus cocophilus Symptoms Oldest leaves of palm turning yellow and wilting; reddish-brown rot in bole tissue; destruction of root system Cause Fungus Comments Some grasses such as Bermuda grass have been reported as alternative hosts fro the fungi Management Any infected trees must be uprooted and burned; area can only be replanted once soil is treated for the disease Stem bleeding disease Chalara paradoxa (syn. Thielaviopsis paradoxa, Ceratocystis paradoxa ) The canopy of the coconut in the center is wilted and necrotic due to a trunk infection by Thielaviopsis paradoxa.Only one side of this trunk has significant rot due to Thielaviopsis paradoxa.The fungus rots the trunk tissue from the outside to the inside.The three coconuts on the left have died from Thielaviopsis trunk rot.The palm in the foreground exhibits trunk collapse.The trunk of this coconut was just beginning to exhibit "stem bleeding", but the large rusty-brown area at the top was already soft.
Trunk collapse due to stem bleeding disease Stem bleeding on a coconut trunk. The top of the blackened area was very soft and could be easily pushed in with the fingers.Symptoms Soft, yellow rot on trunk; affected areas are dark and turn black as they mature; a reddish-brown liquid may ooze from rotting regions and spill down trunk.Cause Fungus Comments Fungi enter the trunk through wounds.Management Avoid wounding palms with machinery and tools to reduce disease incidence; disease can be controlled with applications of the fungicide benomyl where registered; infected trees should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible.Category : Viral Cadang-cadang Coconut cadang-cadang viroid (CCCVd) Area with cadang-cadang disease showing trees in the early, medium and late stages of the disease.

The petioles of the leaves stand erect and can reach lengths in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft). The leaf blades are large and heart-shaped and can reach 50 cm (15.8 in) in length.The corm produces lateral buds which give rise to tubers or cormels and suckers or stolons.Cocoyams commonly reach in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and although they are perennials, they are often grown as annuals, harvested after one season.Colocasia species may also be referred to as taro, old cocoyam, arrowroot, eddoe, macabo or dasheen and originates from Southeast or Central Asia.Xanthosoma species may be referred to as tannia, yautia, new cocoyam or Chinese taro and originates from Central and South America.

Colocasia is grown for its corm which is consumed after boiling, frying or roasting.The corms can be dried and used to make flour or sliced and fried to make chips.The leaves of the plant are also edible and are usually consumed as a vegetable after cooking in dishes such as stews.Xanthosoma species produce tubers much like potato and are boiled, baked, steamed or fried prior to consumption.The corm of some varieties is also consumed.Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable.
Colocasia corms Propagation Basic requirements Cocoyam grows best in fertile, well-draining, sandy loam soil with a pH between 4.2â€“7.5.It can be grown in a wide variety of conditions including paddies in wetland areas using a system similar to that of rice. Xanthosoma species require temperatures above 21Â°C (69.8Â°F) to grow properly.Unlike Colocasia spp, they will not tolerate waterlogging and grow best in deep, well-draining loams with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 in partial shade.Cocoyam will thrive when planted in full sunlight or partial shade.The plants can survive for short periods at temperatures of 10Â°C (50Â°F) but will be damaged or killed by lower temperatures.Propagation Cocoyam is vegetatively propagated from headsetts (â€œtopsâ€​) or suckers which establish quickly and give the highest rate of survival.
Larger headsetts and suckers tend to produce larger corms and bigger yeilds but the size of the planting material may be determined by the particular cultivar being grown e.g. some varieties will produce two heads from the same corm if the sucker that is planted is too big and therefore medium sized suckers are selected when growing tubers for export.Headsetts and suckers should only be taken from healthy plants in order to protect yields and prevent the spread of diseases.Planting Cocoyam is planted in such a way as to encourage sucker growth e.g.the use of larger plant spacing and shallow planting depths.The planting material (sucker or headsett) is set in furrows or ridges and plant spacing can be anywhere between 30 to 100 cm (11.8â€“39.4 in) between plants depending on the prevailing soil and climatic conditions.A narrow spacing helps to control weeds whereas a wider spacing is preferred for good growth.Cocoyam plantation in Cameroon References Anon.Growing Cocoyam in Nigeria.

The coffee plant has a woody perennial evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 30 feet (9 meters) tall in the wild, although it is usually pruned to a height of 6â€“10 feet (1.8â€“3 meters) to make it easier to manage for cultivation. The plant has a straight trunk, elliptical leaves, and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters.After the flowers are pollinated, the fruit, known as a coffee cherry, develops.Each cherry usually contains two seeds, which are the coffee beans that are harvested and roasted to make the coffee beverage.It takes 2 to 3 years for a coffee plant to mature and start producing berries, and it can continue to produce coffee berries for up to 25 years under good conditions.Coffee berries Coffee plantation Flower close-up Coffee flowers Coffee plant Berries and foliage Coffee Varieties The two main coffee varieties are Arabica ( Coffea arabica ) and Robusta ( Coffea canephora ).
Arabica is the most widely consumed and accounts for approximately 60% of the world's coffee production. Arabica coffee is grown at high altitudes, typically above 2,000 feet (600 meters) above sea level, and is known for its delicate and complex flavor profile.Its berries have a smoother, sweeter taste, with notes of fruit, berries, chocolate, and nuts.They also have a lower caffeine content compared to robusta beans, which makes them a popular choice among coffee enthusiasts.On the other hand, robusta coffee beans are known for their strong and bitter taste, higher caffeine content, and lower acidity.The plants can grow at lower altitudes, typically between 900 and 1200 feet above sea level, and are generally more disease-resistant and easier to cultivate compared to arabica.It has a shallow root system and grows as a shrub tree to almost 10 meters tall and has evenly distributed flowers.
It takes 10 to 11 meters for the cherries to ripen, though this ripening is determined by the rainfall distribution. Robusta beans are commonly used in espresso blends and instant coffees due to their strong flavor profile and affordability.In Uganda, a number of varieties have been developed by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO), and close to 10 varieties of coffee that are high-yielding and resistant to coffee wilt have been released.These run from KR1 to KR10 (KR is an abbreviation for Kituza Robusta).Other coffee varieties include: Liberica : A coffee variety that is grown primarily in West Africa and Southeast Asia.Liberica beans have a unique flavor profile that is often described as smoky and woody with a floral aftertaste.They are known for their large size and irregular shape.Excelsa : A coffee variety that is grown primarily in Southeast Asia.Excelsa beans have a tart and fruity flavor with hints of dark chocolate and a floral aroma.
They are often used to add complexity to coffee blends. Maragogype : A coffee variety that is grown primarily in Central and South America.Maragogype beans are very large and have a distinctive flavor that is often described as mild and nutty.Catuai : A hybrid coffee variety that is a cross between Caturra and Mundo Novo.Catuai beans are grown primarily in Central and South America and are known for their high yield and balanced flavor profile.Bourbon : A coffee variety that is grown primarily in Central and South America and Africa.Bourbon beans have a sweet and fruity flavor with a bright acidity and are often used in specialty coffee blends.These are just a few examples of the many different coffee varieties that exist.Each variety has its own unique flavor profile and characteristics, and they are often used in different ways in the coffee industry.Uses Coffee has a variety of uses beyond being a popular beverage.
It is often used as an ingredient in cooking and baking, adding a rich and complex flavor to dishes. Coffee is also commonly used in the production of chocolate and is a key ingredient in espresso-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.In addition to its culinary uses, coffee has non-culinary uses as well.For example, coffee grounds can be used as a natural exfoliant in beauty products or as a deodorizer in the home.The caffeine in coffee is also used in some medications and cosmetics, as it has stimulating properties.Furthermore, coffee has been shown to have a variety of health benefits, including improving cognitive function and reducing the risk of certain diseases.Overall, coffee is a versatile and valuable commodity that has a range of uses beyond just being a beverage.Climatic, soil, and water conditions Growing coffee requires specific climatic, soil, and water conditions.
It is a tropical crop that thrives in areas with warm temperatures, abundant rainfall, and well-drained soil. The ideal temperature range for coffee growth is between 60- 70Â°F (15-24Â°C).Heat stress can be caused by temperatures above 86 Â°F (30 Â°C), while temperatures below 50 Â°F (10 Â°C) can damage the coffee cherries.In terms of rainfall, coffee plants require a lot of water but also need well-drained soil to prevent root rot.The ideal rainfall range for coffee growth is between 1200mm and 1800mm, well distributed over a period of nine months, with consistent rainfall throughout the growing season.The soil type and quality are also important factors in coffee production.Coffee plants require nutrient-rich soil with good drainage, a slightly acidic pH level (between 5.5 and 6.5), and good aeration.The soil should also be deep enough to allow the roots to penetrate and access water and nutrients.
Additionally, coffee plants grow best in areas with high levels of organic matter, which can be provided through the use of compost or other organic fertilizers. Water is also a critical factor in coffee production.Coffee plants require consistent access to water throughout the growing season, with frequent watering during dry spells.However, the soil must also be well-drained to prevent waterlogging, which can cause root rot and other diseases.In some areas, irrigation systems may be necessary to ensure that the plants receive adequate water.Overall, the climatic, soil, and water conditions for growing coffee must be carefully managed to ensure a successful harvest and high-quality cherries.Planting Procedure The coffee planting procedure typically involves the following steps: Land preparation : The land must be cleared of any existing vegetation, rocks, and other debris.The soil should then be tilled to a depth of at least 30 cm to loosen and aerate it.
Selection of seedlings : High-quality coffee seedlings should be selected from a reputable nursery or developed from seeds. Seedlings should be healthy, disease-free, and at least six months old.Digging of holes : Holes should be dug at least 60 cm (2 feet) deep and 60 cm (2 feet) wide enough to accommodate the root ball of the seedling.The holes should be 3 meters apart.Planting of seedlings : The seedlings should be carefully placed in the center of the hole.The soil in the hole should be uniformly mixed with well decomposed manure to boost growth and root establishment.Pest and disease-free seedlings should be selected.Mulching : Â This is the covering of topsoil between the coffee trees.A layer of organic mulch, such as dry leaves or grass, coffee husks, composted manure, maize stalks, and rice stalks, should be applied around the base of the seedling to help retain moisture and suppress weed growth.Mulching regulates soil moisture, controls soil erosion, and helps retain water.
Watering : The newly planted seedlings should be watered immediately and regularly to ensure that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. In dry spells or when the rains aren't regular, water bottle irrigation should be used, as this is the cheapest of all.Pruning : Â At a later stage, when the plant has grown, pruning should be done to remove any weak, dead, unproductive, diseased, and broken branches and promote the growth of a strong central stem.Pruning reduces competition for nutrients and sunlight on the stem or plant and removes unproductive parts to help the plant grow vigorously.It should be carried out at the end of the harvesting season, just before flowering takes place.Fertilization : Regular fertilization is necessary to provide the coffee plants with the nutrients they need to grow and produce high-quality cherries.Pest and disease control : Pests and diseases lead to reduced production, reduced quality, and losses to the farmer.
Some of the pests include the Coffee Twin borer (BCTB), Coffee Berry Borer (CBB), Coffee Mealyburg, Coffee Leaf Miner, Coffee Leaf Skeletonizer, tailed caterpillars and Tailed Ant. Some of the Disease of Coffee include, Coffee Wilt Disease also known as "Fusarium wilt" or "Tracheomycosis spp" (CWD), Coffee Leafrust , Red blister (Cercospora caffeicola) and Root rot or Collar Crack Disease (Armillaria mella).Pests and diseases can be managed to reduce the rate of infection by doing different practices, consulting government extension officers, PlantVillage field extension officers, or seeking knowledge through the PlantVillage Nuru application, which can be downloaded for free from the Google Playstore.Other maintenance practices : Coffee plants require regular maintenance, including pest and disease control weeding, planting shade trees around the garden, planting cover crops within the plantation, irrigation, and thinning to ensure healthy growth and optimal yields.
The specific planting procedures may vary depending on the location, climate, and soil conditions, but the above steps provide a general overview of the process. Shaded coffee nursery Coffee seedlings in polyethylene bags Coffee nursery beds Harvesting Coffee is typically harvested by hand, which involves picking the ripe coffee cherries from the coffee plants.This can be accomplished through the use of either selective or strip-picking methods.Selective picking :Â involves going through the coffee fields and picking only the ripe coffee cherries.This is typically done in several phases, as the coffee cherries do not all ripen at the same time.The picker will gently pull the ripe cherry from the tree, taking care not to damage the surrounding branches or unripe cherries.Strip picking : Also known as "milking,"Â this is the complete removal of all the berries from the coffee tree at once.
It can be done manually with hands or with machinery that shakes the tree and knocks off all of the cherries. However, strip picking is discouraged since it involves mixing mature and ripe cherries with immature and unripe ones, leading to ununiform drying and eventually reducing the taste and quality of the final product.After harvesting, the coffee cherries are processed to remove the outer layers and reveal the coffee cherries inside.There are two main processing methods, which areÂ dry processing and wet processing.Dry processing : This is the drying of harvested coffee cherries under the sun.Solar dryers, cement floors, tarpaulins, and raised tables are used.In Uganda, for example, this process takes 2â€“4 weeks, depending on the weather conditions.The dried coffee is now called "kiboko," and it should be free of dust, mold, and a bad smell with a recommended moisture content of 13â€“14% before being taken to the milling machine.
At the machine, the outer cover is removed from the inner beans. The outer cover is now coffee husks, and the dried beans are now called "clean coffee" or "FAQ," which means fair to average quality.This is then graded to different screen sizes and packed for storage, export, or value addition.Wet Processing : Coffee processed using this method usually fetches high prices because it's of a higher quality than the one under dry harvesting; however, this process is more complicated and requires specific tools to run it.The processing can be a full wash or a semi-wash.Â In a full wash, the skin of the freshly harvested berries is removed either manually or using a pulling machine with the addition of water.Mucilage (the sugary coating) is fermented for 2â€“3 days, and the parchment is washed to remove all the fermented mucilage.The parchment is dried to attain the recommended 12â€“13% moisture content.
To dry 1 kg of fresh berries, 5 to 10 liters of water are required, as well as good management in washing and fermenting to ensure that the flavor is not lost in the process.Â In a semi-wash, the fresh skin is physically removed using a pulling machine with the addition of water to avoid damaging the fabric. The mucin is then immediately removed with a mucin machine.No fermentation is done here.Once the mucilage is removed, the berries are now ready for drying to attain a moisture content of 12 to 13%.This process is faster than the full wash and uses less waterâ€”usually 0.5 to 1 liter for 1 kg of fresh cherries.However, it is not commonly used since a lot of expensive machines are used.Â It usually takes 7â€“12 days to dry the parchment coffee.This must be properly dried to avoid the growth of mold, rotting, and aflatoxins.Usually, farmers under this system use raised wire meshes under a shade to avoid direct sunlight from cracking the beans.
12â€“13% moisture content should be maintained, and the coffee shouldn't be put in bare grounds or dirty environments.

The earliest reports of the disease hail from the 1860s. It was reported first by a British explorer from regions of Kenya around Lake Victoria in 1861 from where it is believed to have spread to Asia and the Americas.Rust was first reported in the major coffee growing regions of Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) in 1867 and the causal fungus was first fully described by the English mycologist Michael Joseph Berkeley and his collaborator Christopher Edmund Broome after an analysis of specimens of a â€œcoffee leaf diseaseâ€​ collected by George H.K.Thwaites in Ceylon.Berkeley and Broome named the fungus Hemileia vastatrix , Hemileia referring to the half smooth characteristic of the spores and vastatrix for the devastating nature of the disease.It is unknown exactly how the rust reached Ceylon from Ethiopia but over the years that followed, the disease was recorded in India in 1870, Sumatra in 1876, Java in 1878, and the Philippines in 1889.
During 1913 it crossed the African continent from Kenya to the Congo, where it was found in 1918, before spreading to West Africa, the Ivory Coast (1954), Liberia (1955), Nigeria (1962- 63) and Angola (1966). The collapse of the coffee industry in Ceylon In the nineteenth century, Ceylon was one of the largest coffee producing regions in the world, responsible for the export of approximately 42 million kilos of coffee per year.In the 28 years following the arrival of rust, export ceased and production was reduced to less than 3 kg/year.It wasnâ€™t until 1879 that the government of Ceylon set up a commission to investigate the crisis and the British government sent Harry Marshall Ward to the plantations.Wardâ€™s work on the coffee rust fungus would establish him as one of the most important figures in the field of plant pathology.
Ward was able to link the collapse of the coffee crop to the Hemileia vastatrix fungus and, identify characteristics of both the fungal spore and agricultural practices that caused such a catastrophic loss. Unfortunately the investigation came too late and the rust epidemic was too far advanced.Ward could do little other than document the complete collapse of the coffee crop, as has been recounted in many histories of the disease (Large, 1940, Carefoot and Sprott 1967, Money 2007).Wardâ€™s observations however, would provide the crucial basis for the development of future control strategies, discussed below.Biology and ecology of coffee rust The collapse of the Sri Lankan coffee industry and Wardâ€™s investigation of the agricultural practices being employed highlighted the problems created by planting coffee at such high densities.
The proximity of the plants to one another created optimal conditions for rust transmission over short distances while the reduced genetic diversity resulting from the practice of monoculture meant that once the rust pathogen broke down the inherent host resistance, little could be done to prevent its spread. The pathogen, Hemileia vastatrix , evolved within the forest and adapted to the widely dispersed nature of the wild host by producing highly mobile spores that are capable of travelling large distances via wind currents, water splash and on the bodies of insects.The practice of removing native trees to plant coffee side by side, removed a natural barrier to the movement of the rust spores and helped compound the catastrophic crop losses witnessed in Ceylon.
Rust transmission and infection Coffee leaf rust is an obligate parasite and is transmitted when urediniospores (spores produced from the brown-red rust pustules) disperse from one part of the plant to another, or to a new, uninfected plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the leaf from uredinia which make up part of the red/orange pustules on the undersides of the leaves.When the spores erupt, they enter the air current where they can travel a few centimeters to the next leaf, or hundreds of kilometers to another site (spores have been recorded travelling 1,000 m up in the high altitude air streams).The spores are also known to travel over shorter distances by rain-splash, which is a common way for plant pathogens to travel from leaf to leaf of the same tree.There are also documented cases of spores being transported to new sites by small insects such as Thrips and parasitoid wasps.
When the spores reach a leaf, they attach to the surface using the spines on their rough side. In order for the spores to germinate, they require the presence of liquid water on the leaves and a temperature of 17 to 25Â°C (62.6 to 77Â°F), with 22Â°C (71.6Â°F) being optimal.Heavy rains can wash the spores from the leaves and prevent infection occurring.When conditions are favorable, the spores produce a long tubes known as germ tubes which move over the leaf searching for a stomata (tiny openings in the leaf surface where plants breathe and release water).The germ tubes produce appressoria (flattened fungal structures that produce â€˜pegsâ€™ to puncture through host tissues) on, or close to the stomata, from which infection hyphae grow and puncture the host cells.The entire infection process is completed in 24 to 48 hours and new urediniospores erupt from the stomatal openings after 10 to 14 days.
One rust lesion will produce 4â€“6 spore crops over a 3â€“5 month period releasing 300â€“400,000 spores into the environment to repeat the process. The 2012 Coffee leaf rust epidemic In 2012 there was a major increase in coffee rust across ten Latin American and Caribbean countries.The disease became an epidemic and the resulting crop losses pushed coffee prices to an all time high amid concerns for supply.The reasons for the epidemic remain unclear but an emergency rust summit meeting in Guatemala in April 2013 compiled a long list of shortcomings.These included a lack of resources to control the rust, the dismissal of early warning signs, ineffective fungicide application techniques, lack of training, poor infrastructure and conflicting advice.
In a keynote talk at the â€œLetâ€™s Talk Royaâ€​ meeting (El Salvador, November 4th 2013), Dr Peter Baker, a senior scientist at CAB International, raised several key points regarding the epidemic including the proportional lack of investment in research and development in such a high value industry and the lack of investment in new varieties in key coffee producing countries such as Colombia. Management Resistant varieties Commercially grown coffee has, through the practice of monocultures, lost much of the genetic diversity of its wild ancestors.Sadly, due to the effects of deforestation, wild coffee has also lost much of its genetic diversity outside of its evolutionary center in Ethiopia.The breeding of crop varieties which are resistant to key pathogens has proven to be a very successful method of controlling diseases and inIn the late 1950s, a natural coffee hybrid was discovered growing wild in East Timor.The plant was found to be a hybrid of C.arabica and C.
canephora and was named HibrÃ​do de Timor (HDT). The plant was found to possess full or partial resistance to all known races of the rust pathogen and five genes were subsequently elucidated from the hybrid and from other coffee varieties that were responsible for conferring the resistance Varieties expressing some of these genes have been grown commercially but the the resistance was broken-down after a few years when new virulent races of the rust pathogen emerged.Crosses of the hybrid with other commercial cultivars produced the â€˜Colombiaâ€™ cultivar which is now widely planted.Colombia managed to reduce its losses during the 2012/13 epidemic because of new plantings.Many Colombian farmers are now replanting with Castillo or Colombia varieties.
Fungicides Copper-containing fungicides Copper-containing fungicides remain one of the most effective and economical methods of controlling the rust pathogen in susceptible coffee varieties and during conditions which are favorable to the development of rust. They have the added advantage of being active against a number of other fungal pathogens and have also been shown to increase coffee yields.Examples of copper-containg fungicides used in coffee include copper oxychloride and cuprous oxide which have largely replaced the use of Bordeaux mixture in most commercial plantations.These chemicals are applied protectively with plants being sprayed in advance of infection and work by adhering to the plant and producing a toxic barrier to invading fungal pathogens.They pose limitations due to their need to be reapplied at regular intervals to protect new growth flushes and also pose environmental concerns over the accumulation of copper to toxic levels in the soil.
Copper- containing fungicides can be alternated with systemic fungicides to reduce the amount of copper build-up. Systemic fungicides Systemic fungicides used in coffee include pyracarbolids such as triadimefon and propiconazole and strobilurins such as azoxystrobin.Systemic fungicides are transported around the plant in the vascular tissue after application thus requiring lower doses and less frequent application than copper-based fungicides.They can be applied after infection has occurred to treat the symptoms of the disease and eradicate it from the host plant.Systemic fungicides tend to be more expensive and some have been shown to induce severe defoliation of the coffee plant.They have been shown to be very effective at controlling rust when used in combination with copper-containing fungicides.Organic fungicides Only one organic fungicide is widely used in coffee - triadimefon.
Triadimefon is a systemic fungicide which is applied to the foliage and works to inhibit the rust infection. It can be alternated or combined with other chemicals and is generally very effective at controlling rust infections.Organically certified control methods Most commercially grown coffee varieties are susceptible to coffee rust fungus and because organic farmers cannot use chemical approaches controlling the rust is extremely hard.(note that in some growing regions copper based fungicides are allowed).Here we discuss a few methods and we encourage others to share knowledge by emailing PlantVillage or answering questions on the forum.i) Planting spore traps.The fungal spore has a rough side that attaches to plant tissue.Wind-break trees can be used to reduce the spore load.Organic coffee is often grown using shade trees which may act to reduce inoculum reaching the coffee plants.
ii) Spraying organic formulations that impacts the ability of the spore to germinate or of new spores to be produced. We have heard that some farmers had success with this strategy but we do not know the details.Dr Peter Baker of CABI has reported to us that some farmers are using lime sulphur because of the expense of copper.We will try and find more information.Please contact PlantVillage if you have information.iii) Spraying water.It is feasible that high pressure water can wash the spores from the leaves and reduce the spore load.Heavy rains may also have the same effect.As humidity on the leaves actually promotes fungal growth then washing is best done when the water is likely to evaporate.Biological control Concepts Biological control is the use of one living organism to control another living organism that is considered a pest species.
In addition to breeding new and better genetic material and the use of good crop husbandry, the development of an effective biological control strategy could provide another tool to manage coffee rust which would allow for organic certification and the continued use of heirloom varieties. If a suitable agent(s) can be identified in the short term, then this approach would be available in significantly less time than that needed to develop a new variety.CBC of fungi exploits the ability of coevolved fungal natural enemies in order to produce massive quantities of inoculum on the host plant and allow them to spread and propagate continuously within the host population.It offers a sustainable control method but has and has, surprisingly, never been used for crop pathogens (diseases).
The concept is simple and follows the enemy-release hypothesis whereby an exotic or alien species increases its fitness, and hence its invasiveness, because it arrives without its guild of co- evolved natural enemies. Examples i) Bacteria Bacteria such as Bacillus and Pseudomonas are known to produce compounds that negatively affect fungal pathogens of plants.Such bacteria evolved in the soil and utilize antifungal compounds to compete with soil dwelling fungi.A number of studies have shown how coffee rust development in greenhouse settings or in the lab can be retarded by Bacillus and Pseudomonas .For example, a study by Haddad et al, 2009 showed for the first time that certain strains of< i>Bacillus and Pseudomonas reduced coffee rust on organic farms in Brazil.In follow up work the same team (Haddad et al 2014) found 17 different bacterial isolates collected from leaves, leaf debris, and soil reduced both the infection frequency and the number of H.
vastatrix urediniospores produced per leaf by more than 70%. ii) Other fungi White halo fungus, Lecanicillium lecanii , has been suggested as a potential biological control agent of coffee rust by Prof.John Vandermeer and collaborators at the University of Michigan (Vandermeer et al 2009).White halo fungus has been shown to be hyperparasitic on Hemileia vastatrix in laboratory conditions and it has also been observed attacking the fungus in the field.White halo fungus often infects green coffee scale which feed on coffee.These insects are frequently tended by ants which collect the sugar that they excrete.The ants often create clusters of scale insects on the plants which are infected with white halo disease.It is postulated that white halo fungus may attack and kill the coffee leaf rust fungus or may simply reduce its abundance due to crowding effects or produce chemicals to attack it.
Currently, the fungus does not appear be a viable biological control agent because it has not evolved to parasitize the fungi, rather it evolved to infect insects. Promising attempts have been made to culture the fungus and apply it as a topical spray to control the rust fungus.Future prospects Currently, no CBC program has focused explicitly on controlling coffee rust but pathogenic rusts have themselves been used to control other pests.For example, rubber vine is considered to be a major pest plant in Australia as it is highly invasive and causes millions of dollars of damage to agriculture and massive ecological damage.A team led by Dr.Harry Evans, a scientific officer with CAB International, identified a rust called Maravalia (which is taxonomically close to coffee rust) in the center of genetic origin for rubber vine in Madagascar which showed potential for use as a CBC agent.Before the rust could be released in the environment in Australia, it had to be quarantined.
This process removed the rust from its natural enemies and had the effect of making the rust fungus extremely pathogenic. Dr.Evanâ€™s stated that the rust went â€˜berserkâ€™ and when it was eventually deployed in Australia, it was extremely successful at controlling the rubber vine, even killing off young seedlings.In 2014, another team led by Dr.Evans and Dr.Roberto Barretto of the Federal University of Vicosa in Brazil will begin to explore genetic centers of origin of Arabica coffee with the aim of identifying similar co-evolved natural enemies of Hemileia vastatrix .It is believed that CBC holds great promise for the future control of coffee rust.

Collards are erect, branched plants with thick stems and irregularly lobed dark green leaves with long petioles. The plant produces clusters of small yellow flowers on racemes.Collards can reach 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and are usually grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season.Collards may also be referred to as collard greens or tree cabbage and likely originated from a wild ancestor in ancient Asia minor.Collards and mustard greens Harvested collard greens ready for sale Collard plant Harvested collard leaves Collards Uses Collards leaves are usually consumed after cooking and are eaten as a leafy green vegetable.Collard greens Content Propagation Basic requirements Collard greens are a cool season crop that grow best in cool, moist conditions.The plant will grow best at temperatures between 4 and 21Â°C (40â€“50Â°F) allowing it to be grown in both Spring and Fall.Collards are very hardy and will tolerate frost.
The plants will grow optimally in a rich, moist, well draining soil with a pH of 6.5. Collard greens requires at least six hours of direct sunlight every day.Sowing seeds Collard greens can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants.The optimum soil temperature for germination is between 12 and 24Â°C (55â€“75Â°F).Collard seeds should be planted after any danger of hard frost or in a cold frame for transplanting to their final location.For Fall harvest, plant collard seeds in July so that the plants develop in cooler weather.Prepare the soil for planting through the addition of nitrogen in the form of bone meal or composted manure.Plant seeds 6 mm (0.25 in) deep allowing 3.5 cm (1 in) between plants in the row, allowing 0.6â€“1.2 m (2â€“4 ft) between rows.Thin seedlings to a final within row spacing of 30â€“60 cm (12â€“24 in).Keep soil moist during germination to prevent a crust from forming on the soil surface as this will cause uneven germination.
Transplanting Seedlings started indoors or in a cold frame are ready to be transplanted when they have 5â€“6 true leaves. Seedlings should be planted at the final spacing for seeds (30â€“60 cm/12â€“24 in between plants and 0.6 to 1.2 m/2â€“4 ft between rows).Plant each seedling slightly deeper than it was previously.The plantings can be staggered in 2 week intervals to prolong the harvest.General care and maintenance Collards should be kept evenly watered, application of mulch around plants helps to conserve soil moisture.The plants have shallow roots and in order to avoid damaging them, it is preferable to hand pull any weeds growing around the plants.Collards are heavy feeders, requiring plentiful nitrogen to meet their growth requirements and develop optimally.Apply an appropriate complete fertilizer when thinning seedlings.Harvesting Collard greens can be harvested about 2 months after planting.Harvest the outer leaves to avoid damaging the growing tip of the plant.
Collard leaves are sweeter when they are harvested after frost..

Symptoms Brown to tan concentric rings with yellow edges on leaves; centers of lesions developing gray to brown soft fungal mold; brown to black lesions with a black border on roots Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors warm, wet conditons Management Plant only pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; applications of appropriate fungicides control disease when present Anthracnose Colletotrichum higginsianum Symptoms Small circular or irregularly shaped dry spots which are gray to straw in color on leaves; a high number of spots may cause the leaf to die; lesions may coalesce to form large necrotic patches causing leaves to turn yellow and wilt; lesions may split or crack in dry centers; dry sunken spots on roots which enlarge and turn gray or brown Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters on leaf debris and on related weeds; disease emergence is favored by moist, warm conditions Management Control of disease depends on sanitary practices; treat seeds with hot water prior to planting; rotate crops; plant in an area with good soil drainage; remove all cruciferous weeds which may act as a reservoir for the fungus Black rot Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms Seedlings develop wilted yellow to brown leaves and collapse; yellow, V-shaped lesions on mature leaf margins; dark rings can be found in the cross section of the stem Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors warm, wet conditions Management Primary control methods based on good sanitation; plant disease-free seed; rotate crops every 2 years or less to non- brassica; avoid sprinkler irrigation Cercospora leaf spot (Frogeye leaf spot) Cercospora brassicicola Symptoms Angular or circular green to gray spots with brown borders on leaves; plant defoliation may occur in the case of a severe infestation Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool temperatures and wet weather Management Plant only certified disease-free seed; avoid overhead irrigation; rotate crops to non-brassica species for 2-3 years; apply appropriate fungicide if disease emerges Clubroot Plasmodiophora brassicae Symptoms Slow growing, stunted plants; yellowish leaves which wilt during day and rejuvenate in part at night; swollen, distorted roots; extensive gall formation Cause Fungus Comments Can be difficult to distinguish from nematode damage; fungus can survive in soil for periods in excess of 10 years; can be spread by movement of contaminated soil and irrigation water to uninfected areas Management Once the pathogen is present in the soil it can survive for many years, elimination of the pathogen is economically unfeasible; rotating crops generally does not provide effective control; plant only certified seed and avoid field grown transplants unless produced in a fumigated bed; applying lime to the soil can reduce fungus sporulation Downy mildew Peronospora parasitica Downy mildew symptoms on collards Downy mildew symptoms on collards Symptoms Gray to white fluffy mold on the underside of leaves; tan to yellow dry spots on upper surface of leaves; leaves dropping Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool temperatures; disease spreads quickly in wet conditions Management Remove all crop debris after harvest; rotate with non-brassicas; application of appropriate fungicides may be required if symptoms of disease are present White leaf spot Pseudocercosporella capsellae Symptoms Small, necrotic, brown spots on leaf tips or margins that matures to light gray or white with the original dark spot in center; margins of lesions may be darker; lesions may coalesce to form large chlorotic areas and cause defoliation Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool and wet conditions Management No known plant resistance to white leaf spot so control relies on cultural practices such as rotating crops and removing weeds; application of appropriate fungicide may help control the disease Wirestem (Damping-off) Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Death of seedlings after germination; brown-red or black rot girdling stem; seedling may remain upright but stem is constricted and twisted (wirestem) Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors slow growing, deeply seeded plants and cool, wet soils Management Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants that have been produced in sterilized soil; apply fungicide to seed to kill off any fungi; shallow plant seeds or delay planting until soil warms Pests Category : Insects Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Young larvae Beet armyworm eggs covered in white hairs Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling the beet armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicaea Cabbage aphid colony Symptoms Large populations can cause stunted growth or even plant death; insects may be visible on the plant leaves and are small, grey-green in color and soft bodied and are covered with a white waxy coating; prefer to feed deep down in cabbage head and may be obscured by the leaves Cause Insect Comments Cabbage aphids feed only on cruciferous plants but may survive on related weed species Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper and damage Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Cutworm feeding on plant stem Cutworm larva severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella Larva feeding on cabbage leaf Diamondback moth pupae Symptoms Young larvae feed between upper and lower leaf surface and may be visible when they emerge from small holes on the underside of the leaf; older larvae leave large, irregularly shaped shotholes on leaf undersides, may leave the upper surface intact; larvae may drop from the plant on silk threads if the leaf is disturbed; larvae are small (1 cm/0.3 in) and tapered at both ends; larvae have to prolegs at the rear end that are arranged in a distinctive V-shape Cause Insect Comments Larvae take between 10 and 14 days to mature and spin a loose, gauze-like cocoon on leaves or stems to pupate Management Larvae can be controlled organically by applications of Bacillus thurengiensis or Entrust; application of appropriate chemical insecticide is only necessary if larvae are damaging the growing tips of the plants Flea beetles Phylotreta spp.
Crucifer flea beetle damage on broccoli leaf Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Large cabbage white (Cabbageworm) Pieres rapae Cabbageworm and frass Symptoms Large ragged holes in leaves or bored into head; green-brown frass (insect feces) on leaves; caterpillar is green in color and hairy, with a velvet-like appearance; may have faint yellow to orange stripes down back; slow-moving compared with other caterpillars Cause Insect Comments Larvae can be distinguished from other caterpillars by their sluggish movement; in large numbers larvae can cause extensive damage very quickly About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us Management Hand-pick caterpillars from plants and destroy; scrape eggs from leaves prior to hatching; apply appropriate insecticide if infestation is very heavy Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.

The leaves of the plant are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems. It is a soft, hairless plant.The flowers are produced in small umbels and are white or very pale pink in color with the petals pointing away from the centre of the umbel longer than those pointing towards it.The plant produces an oval shaped fruit which is yellow-brown in color and contains two seeds.Coriander is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and reaches up to 50 cm (19.7 in).Coriander may also be referred to as cilantro, chinese parsley or dhania and originates from the Near East.Coriander foliage Coriander fruits Honey bee on coriander flower Coriander flowers Coriander foliage Uses All parts of the coriander plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are most commonly used.Leaves and seeds are used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking.
Coriander (Cilantro) Content Dried coriander seeds are used as a spice Propagation Basic requirements The plant grows optimally in areas with damp, cool springs and hot, dry summers at temperatures between 17 and 27Â°C (62.6â€“80.6Â°F) depending on the variety. The plant can tolerate light frost but hot temperatures will cause the plants to bolt.Coriander grows best in well-draining soil and can be grown in sandy loam, loam and clay soils as long as there is sufficient drainage.The plants will grow best when positioned in full sun.Propagation Coriander is propagated directly from seeds and should be sown after the last frost.The seeds should be planted in a prepared bed by planting seeds 0.6 to 1.2 cm (0.25-0.5 in) deep allowing 5cm (2 in) between seeds and 30 to 38 cm (12-15 in) between rows.Plantings can be staggered to ensure a continuous harvest.The seeds should be kept moist.
General care and maintenance Once the young coriander plants are established they require little water as the plants do not perform well in damp conditions. The plants should be kept free of weeds, particularly when they are young to prevent competition for nutrients.The plants will benefit from the addition of fertilizer during the growing season.Phosphorous and potassium often limit the growth of coriander whereas the demand for nitrogen is not very high.Harvest Coriander can be harvested 45 to 70 days after planting.Leaves can be removed from the outside of the plant when they have reached 10 to 15 cm (4-6 in) in length.Commercially grown coriander is harvested by cutting the entire plant at soil level or 4 to 5 cm (1.5-2.0 in) above the crown, The bunches are then secured with a rubber band or tied together with a twist tie.Harvested bunches of coriander Coriander seedlings References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Coriandrum sativum datasheet.

Description Crop Details The following are the crop details for maize (corn) â€¢ Scientific name: Zea mays â€¢ Local names: "Mahindi" in Swahili,Â "maÃ​z" in Spanish, "maÃ¯s" in French, "Mais" in German, "grano" or "mais" in Italian, "milho" in Portuguese, "ç Ž‰ ç±³" (yÃ¹mÇ​) in Chinese, "à¤®à¤•à¥​à¤•à¤¾" (makkÄ​) in Hindi, "Ø°Ø±Ø©" (dhira) in Arabic, and "ÐºÑ ƒ ÐºÑ ƒ Ñ€Ñ ƒ Ð·Ð°" (kukuruza) in Russian â€¢ Order: Poales â€¢ Family: Poaceae â€¢ Subfamily: Panicoideae â€¢ Genus: Zea General Information Maize isÂ a staple food for almost half the population of sub-Saharan Africa and is important for its carbohydrate, proteins, iron, vitamin B, and minerals. The produce is consumed as maize meal (ugali), porridge, pastes, and beer, and can be boiled or roasted as fresh as it comes from the farm.Maize is also processed to produce oils for cooking.It is also Maize (corn) Content an important crop for animal feed.Smallholder farmers are the largest producers of maize in sub-Saharan Africa.
The maize is produced through subsistence farming as part of mixed agricultural systems which lack inputs such as fertiliser, irrigation, improved seeds and efficient labor. In 2017, Africa produced 7.4% of the 1,135 million tonnes produced worldwide in 40 million hectares, according to data by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).Maize field Ripened maize Harvested maize Maize field Maize ear Maize ears Maize silks Maize tassel Maize foliage Maize Varieties The history of maize varieties in the continent spans way back in 1500 AD when the crop was introduced in Africa and spread in every corner of the continent.Today, there are about 50 species with different texture, color, grain sizes and shapes.WhiteÂ and yellow maize are the most commonly cultivated, and production of seed varieties depends on the regionâ€™s soil and climatic conditions.PlantVillage recommends use of certified seeds suitable for appropriate soil and climatic conditions.
Here are some of the maize varieties grown in Kenya: H614: this is a white maize variety that is popular in Kenya due to its high yield potential, good grain quality, and tolerance to diseases such as maize streak virus. H6213: aÂ yellow maize variety is planted for its high yield potential, good grain quality, and tolerance to drought and pests such as the maize stem borer.DH01: this is a hybrid maize variety popular for its high yield potential, good drought tolerance, and resistance to diseases such as maize lethal necrosis disease.PH4: this is a yellow maize variety that is popular in Kenya due to its high yield potential, good resistance to diseases such as leaf rust, and tolerance to drought.DK8031: this hybrid maize variety is popular in Kenya for its high yield potential, good grain quality, and tolerance to diseases such as grey leaf spot.

Longe 8 H: for mid-altitude; maturity of 120-125 days; potential yield of 88--10 bags of 90 kg / ha; excellent husk cover; tolerant to cob rots, drought and poor soil; resistant to maize streak virus, northern leaf blight and grey leaf spot; a very popular hybrid in Uganda. Longe 5 (Nalongo) (QPM Maize): for low land to mid altitude areas;Â maturity of 115 days; potential yield of 40-50 bags of 90 kg / ha; quality protein maize with lysine and tryptophan amino acids; drought tolerant; resistant to maize streak virus, grey leaf spot; moderately resistantÂ to northern leaf blight.Climatic conditions, soils, and water management Maize is a versatile crop that can grow in different varieties of soil, water, and climatic conditions.The crop has a wide range of tolerance to temperature conditions but grows well in warm regions where moisture is sufficient.The crop flourishes in regions with rainfall ranging from 1200mm to 2500mm but can adapt to regions receiving rainfall of up to 400 mm.
The crop requires warm temperatures of between 15Â°C and 30 Â°C and thrives in a range of zones with altitudes ranging from 100 m to 2900 m ASL, depending on the variety. The crop is sensitive to moisture stress around tasseling time and during cob formation.Growth is favorable under a pH ranging from 5-8 with 5.5-7 being optimal because it is sensitive to salinity.Planting Procedure The planting procedure for maize is as follows: Choice of seed The first step to getting maximum yield is ensuring you plant healthy, certified seeds.Apart from the varieties shown above, H614, H626, and H627 for attitudes ranging from 1500 to 2100 M ASL; KATUMANI, DH O2, DH O4, and Drought TEGO for attitudes ranging from 600 to 1300 M ASL; H 513, H 511, and H 516 for attitudes ranging from 800 to 1500 M ASL; and PH1, PH4 for attitudes ranging from 0 to 1200 M ASL are some of the other seed varieties planted in East Africa.
Land Preparation The piece of land for planting maize should be prepared early, before the onset of rains, for weeds to decompose before planting. The following procedure for planting can be followed: Spray weeds with the appropriate chemicals.Plough the land and make it level with a fine tilth.Considering the size of the land, machines like tractors or ox- drawn ploughs can be used, observing the correct spacing.Mix soil with manure and biochar for efficient and improved nutrient uptake as well as stabilizing soil pH.Make holes at a spacing of 90 x 30â€“50 cm if soil fertility is low or 75 x 25â€“50 cm if soil fertility is relatively high.Place 1 or 2 seeds per hole, or alternate 1 and 2 seeds at a depth of about 4 cm if the soil is moist and about 10 cm if the soil is dry.Cover the seeds with loose soil.Planting Time It is important to plant maize early in the season because late planting adversely affects yield.
Plant within two weeks of the onset of rainfall in the highlands and before the onset of rainfall in the lowlands to make use of the scarce rainfall. Thinning and Gapping Gapping is done to replace seeds that did not germinate after others germinated completely.Thinning is done when maize has grown to about 15 cm in height by removing weak and deformed seedlings to make space for healthy seedlings in a hole.Fertilizer application To achieve maximum yield, fertilizer should be applied on time.Manure and biochar can also be added to soil with little or no organic matter.When planting manually, thoroughly mix soil with a teaspoonful of fertilizer into each planting hole to ensure that it doesnâ€™t burn the seeds.Place the seeds on top of the soil and feel for softness.DAP is recommended for planting because it contains phosphorous, which helps in root development.Top dressing Maize can be top dressed with CA 2-3 weeks after planting or when it is 45 cm (1 ft) high.
One teaspoon of fertilizer should be applied to the base of each plant, 15 cm away from the plant in a ring or along the row. Top dress in two stages in areas with heavy rainfall: the first six weeks after sowing and the second 10-15 days later, or just before tussling.In areas experiencing low rainfall, topdressing is done only once at a rate of 50â€“100 kg per acre.Using CAN and urea for topdressing is good because it fixes nitrogen in the soil.Nitrogen increases the green color of the leaves to make food for the plant.Weeding Remove weeds mechanically, manually, or by using herbicides to prevent them from competing with the crops for nutrients, water, and light.First weeding, if done manually, should be done three weeks after planting, depending on the intensity of weeds in the field.
Field Operations Herbicides can be applied in two phases: pre-emergence, which is used before the maize germinates and weeds appear, and post-emergence, which is applied after the maize and weeds germinate. Harvesting Normally, each maize stalk should yield one large ear of maize, but in ideal conditions, the stalk can yield a second, slightly smaller ear that matures slightly later than the first.Maize is ready for harvesting when the kernels within the husks are well packed and produce a milky substance when the kernel is punctured.Maize should be planted in blocks rather than a single row Partially filled ears are usually a result of poor pollination Physiological Diseases Nitrogen deficiency The typical symptom of nitrogen deficiency is the plant turns pale green; a â€˜Vâ€™ shaped yellow coloration on leaves.This pattern starts from leaf end to leaf collar.The symptom begin from lower to upper leaves.
Phosphorous deficiency The deficient plants are dark green and lower leaves show reddish-purple discoloration. Potassium deficiency The leaf margins turn yellow and brown which appears like firing or drying.The symptoms progress from lower leaves to upper leaves.Sulfur deficiency Symptom appears on younger leaves where we will see yellow color striping(interveinal chlorosis).Zinc deficiency Upper leaves shows broad bands of yellow coloration and later turn pale brown or gray necrosis(dead- spots).The symptom first appears in the middle of leaves and progress outward.Zinc deficiency Symptoms of Phosphorous deficiency Field maize plant, the bottom leaf of which is showing symptoms of nitrogen deficiency.Zinc deficiency.Shortening of internodes and light streaking of leaves followed by a broad stripe of bleached tissue on each side of the midrib.Occasionally the leaf edges and interior of the stalks at the nodes appear purplish.
Leaves of maize showing characteristic "V" coloration indicating nitrogen deficiency. Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Anthracnose Colletotrichum graminicola Stalk rot symptom Anthracnose leaf blight on maize Stalk rot symptom due to anthracnose disease (Colletotrichum graminicola) Anthracnose lesion on maize leaf Symptoms of anthracnose on leaves (Colletotrichum graminicola) Anthracnose lesions on maize leaves Symptoms Anthracnose symptoms vary widely depending on numerous factors such as genotype, age of plant and environmental conditions.
- Small oval or elongated water-soaked spots which enlarge up to 15 mm long appear on leaves - Lesions develop a tan center and red-brown or orange border - Lesions may coalesce to form large necrotic(dead) patches - Severely infected leaves on susceptible hybrids may wither and die - Fungal fruiting bodies develop on dead tissues and may produce pink or orange spore masses - Top dieback and stalk rot Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives the winter on crop debris. Emergence of disease is favored by high temperatures and extended periods of wet and cloudy weather - seedlings and mature plants are most susceptible to the disease.Management Plant hybrids resistant to anthracnose; rotating crops and plowing crop debris into soil may help reduce incidence of early season infections.
Cercospora leaf spot (Gray leaf spot) Cercospora zeae-maydis Gray leaf spot Symptoms on maize leaf Gray leaf spot on maize Maize leaf showing characteristic rectangular Cercospora lesions Small necrotic(dead) spots with chlorotic halos on leaves which expand to rectangular lesions 1-6 cm in length and 2-4 mm wide Symptoms Leaf completely blighted by Cercospora Severely blighted leaf caused by Cercospora infection Gray leaf spot (Cercospora zeae- maydis) Close up view of gray leaf spot with white sporulation Cercospora lesions Symptoms Small necrotic spots with chlorotic halos on leaves which expand to rectangular lesions 1-6 cm in length and 2-4 mm wide; as the lesions mature they turn tan in color and finally gray; lesions have sharp, parallel edges and are opaque; disease can develop quickly causing complete blighting of leaves and plant death. 1.Brown Spots with yellow rings throughout the leaf during the growing period of the Cassava 2.Lesions that are 0.15-0.2 cm in diameter 3.
Serious cases can lead to holes throughout the lesions on the leaf Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored in areas where a corn crop is followed by more corn with no rotastion; severity and incidence of disease is likely die to continuous corn culture with minimum tillage and the use of susceptible hybrids in in the midwestern corn belt of the USA; prolonged periods of foggy or cloudy weather can cause severe Cercopora epidemics. Management Plant corn hybrids with resistance to the disease; crop rotation and plowing debris into soil may reduce levels of inoculum in the soil but may not provide control in areas where the disease is prevalent; foliar fungicides may be economically viable for some high yeilding susceptible hybrids.
Charcoal rot Macrophomina phaseolina Inside the infected stalk Infected stalk Corn stalk infected with charcoal rot Damaged stalk Charcoal rot infected stalk Corn stalk infected with charcoal rot Black fruiting body of fungus on infected corn stalk Charcoal stalk rot of field corn (Macrophomina phaseolina) Symptoms Symptoms are usually first apparent at the tasseling stage; plant stalks become shredded and pith is completely rotted with stringy strands of vascular tissue left intact; small, black fungal fruiting bodies are visible in the vascular strands and give the tissue a gray coloration; fungus grows into internodes of the stalk causing the plant to ripen early and causing the stalk to weaken; plant may break. Cause Fungus Comments Emergence of the disease is favored by warm soils with a low moisture content; fungus overwinters in the soil and can also survive on other host plants which include sorghum and soybean.
Management There are currently no available fungicides to treat the disease; avoid stressing plants by practicing good water management; rotating crops with small grains may help reduce disease incidence.
Common rust Puccinia sorghi Common corn rust common corn rust (Puccinia sorghi) Rust symptoms on corn foliage Close-up of rust pustules on corn leaf Common rust infected corn leaf Corn rust (Puccinia sorghi) Rust symptoms on corn foliage Rust symptoms on corn foliage Common corn rust common corn rust (Puccinia sorghi) Rust symptoms on corn foliage Rust pustules on corn leaf Symptoms Oval or elongated cinnamon brown pustules on upper and lower surfaces of leaves; pustules rupture and release powdery red spores; pustules turn dark brown-black as they mature and release dark brown powdery spores; if infection is severe, pustules may appear on tassels and ears and leaves may begin to yellow; in partially resistant corn hybrids, symptoms appear as chlorotic or necrotic flecks on the leaves which release little or no spore. Cause Fungus Comments Disease is spread by wind-borne spores; some of the most popularly grown sweet corn varieties have little or no resistance to the disease.
Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids; application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity; fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf. Common smut (Boil smut, Blister smut) Ustilago zeae Signs and symptoms of common smut (Ustilago maydis) on a corn plant.Smut galls on corn tassels Kernels replaced by smut galls in corn ear Comparison of two corn tassel infected with common smut (center), Ustilago maydis, and head smut (right), Sphacelotheca reiliana.Common smut gall on corn stalk Galls on corn caused by common smut Common smut on sweet corn cv.
White Delight Kernels replaced by smut galls in corn ear Galls on corn caused by common smut Symptoms Tumor-like galls on plant tissues which are initially green-white or silvery white in color; interior of galls darken and turn into masses of powdery dark brown or black spores (with the exception of galls on leaves which remain greenish in color); galls may reach up to 15 cm in diameter and are common on ears, tassels, shoots or midrib of leaves; galls on leaves remain small and do not burst open. Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters on crop debris or in the soil and can survive for several years; fungus usually enters the plant through wounds; application of nitrogen fertilizer increases incidence of disease, while application of phosphorous fertilizer decreases infection.Management Although many practices may be recommended for the control of common smut, the only method that is completely effective is to grow resistant corn hybrids.
Downy Mildew disease Peronosclerospora sorghi (Sorghum downy mildew) P. maydis (Java downy mildew) P.philippinensis (Philippine downy mildew) P.sacchari (Sugarcane downy mildew) Scleropthora rayssiae var.zeae (Brown stripe downy mildew) Sclerospora graminicola (Graminicola downy mildew or green ear) Sclerophthora macrospora (crazy top) Brown stripe downy mildew on maize Philippine downy mildew on maize Sorghum downy mildew on maize Sugarcane downy mildew on maize Underside of maize leaf showing sorghum downy mildew Java downy mildew on maize Symptoms Symptoms of all maize downy mildew pathogens are similar although may vary depends on cultivar, age and climate.The disease appear as early from two weeks after sowing resulting in chlorosis and stunting.In older plants the leaves shows mottling, chlorotic streaking and lesions and white striped leaves.
Usually the leaves are narrower and more erect when compare to healthy plants and are covered with a white, downy growth on both surfaces. Cause Fungus Comments The disease is both air and seed born.The pathogen have several alternative hosts.Management Grow available resistant varieties and hybrids.Follow crop rotation with non host crops.Use suitable systemic fungicide for both seed treatment and foliar spray.Keep the fields free from weeds.Drying seeds before sowing reduces the disease incidence.
Giberrella stalk and ear rot Giberella zeae Bluish black perithecia of Gibberella zeae superficial near nodes Ear infected with Gibberella ear rot Pink mold caused by Gibberella ear rot Ear infected with Gibberella ear rot Ear rot caused by Gibberella fungus Ear infected with Gibberella ear rot Small black fungal fruiting bodies visible on corn stalk Symptoms Plants wilting and leaves changing color from light to dull green; lower stalk turns straw yellow; internal stalk tissue breaks down; interior of stalk has a red discoloration; black fungal fruiting bodies may be visible on the stalk, often at internodes, and can be easily scraped off; if fungal infection affects the ears, it produces a red mold at the tips of the ear which spreads down; early infection may result in the ear being covered in pink mycelium which causes the corn husk to adhere to the ear.
Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can enter through wounds to stalk or ear; ear rot is caused by the fungus infecting silks and moving down through the ear; fungus survives on corn debris in soil and on debris of other host plants such as wheat. Management Stressed plants are more susceptible to Gibberella - providing adequate fertilization and irrigation can help reduce incidence of disease; control insects, especially stem and ear borers; hybrids differ in their susceptibility to the disease and further information is required in order to develop specific control measures.Northern Leaf Blight Exserohilum turcicum Symptoms Symptoms on leaves Blight across the leaf axil areas Close up of leaves demonstrating typical tan-colored, cigar-shaped lesions Infected field Infected leaf Small, tan to brown, somewhat round spots.
May completely cover the leaf Elliptical gray-green lesions on leaves Northern corn leaf blight (Exserohilum turcicum) Symptoms on leaves Long, narrow lesions which are unrestricted by veins Lesions become pale gray to tan color Symptoms In the beginning we will notice elliptical gray-green lesions on leaves. As the disease process this lesions become pale gray to tan color.Later stage the lesions looks dirty due to dark gray spores particularly under lower leaf surface.The disease can be easily identified in the field due to its long, narrow lesions which are unrestricted by veins.Cause Fungus Comments The disease mainly spread through rain splash and wind.Management Follow proper tillage to reduce fungus inoculum from crop debris.Follow crop rotation with non host crop.Grow available resistant varieties.In severe case of disease incidence apply suitable fungicide.
Southern corn leaf blight Bipolaris maydis Bipolaris maydis sporulation Infected field Long, irregular shaped, tan to white lesions. Lesions will appear along the leaf vein Various symptoms of Southern corn leaf blight Southern blight infected cob Corn field infected by Southern corn leaf blight Plant in field infected with Southern corn leaf blight Elongated lesions on corn leaf caused by Southern corn leaf blight Young plant infected with southern blight Southern corn leaf blight and stalk rot (Bipolaris maydis) symptoms Southern corn blight lesions on corn leaf Symptoms Foliar symptoms vary with hybrid and different fungal isolate; lesions on leaves may be tan and elongated and run between leaf veins; lesions may have a buff or brown colored margin; another race of the fungus causes tan, spindle shaped or elliptical lesions with a water-soaked margin that turns into a yellow halo.
Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in corn debris in soil; disease occurs worldwide but is emergence favors areas with a warm, damp climate. Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids; cultural control methods include plowing crop debris into soil after harvest and rotating crops.Category : Bacterial Bacterial leaf blight/stripe Pseudomonas rubrilineans, syn.Pseudomonas avenae, Acidvorax avenae subsp.avenae Maize plant showing tassel rotting, caused when dead leaves enclose the tassel due to severe damage to the top leaves by bacterial leaf stripe (Acidovorax avenae).Bacterial leaf stripe (Acidovorax avenae subsp.avenae) symptoms.Leaves develop several small, pale- green lesions which expand along veins producing a conspicuous striping, mainly in the youngest leaves.
Bacterial leaf blight and stalk rot (Acidovorax avenae) symptom Symptoms Water-soaked linear lesions on leaves as they emerge; lesions turn brown and may subsequently turn gray or white; lesions may have a red border; after the leaves are mature, lesions do not tend to extend any further; no new lesions tend to appear after tasseling; if corn variety is susceptible, mature leaves may shred after maturity. Cause Bacterium Comments Bacteria can also cause disease in oats, barley, wheat, some millets and sorghum.Management Resistant hybrids should be planted in areas where the disease is prevalent; plowing crop debris into soil and rotating crop may not be effective at controlling the disease due to its extensive host range.Bacterial Leaf Streak disease Xanthomonas vasicola pv.vasculorum (syn Xanthomonas campestris pv.zeae) Initial symptoms Symptoms on corn leaf Symptoms The infected leaves initially shows narrow stripes between the veins.
The initial symptoms are generally confused with gray leaf spot disease. But the lesions from bacteria appear brown, orange, and/or yellow when you infected leaves are back-lit.Also in Bacterial Leaf Streak disease the lesions show slightly wavy edges when compared to the smooth, linear lesion margins of gray leaf spot.Cause Bacterium Comments The bacteria causes gumming disease on sugarcane in several part of the world.First reported on corn in South Africa.Currently this disease is reported in Nebraska (Aug.26, 2016), Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas on corn.Management Use healthy and disease free seeds.Remove the infected plant debris and burn them.Follow crop rotation.

Cause Virus Comments Virus is transmitted by more than 15 different species of aphid and is passed to the plant from the insect in seconds to minutes of feeding; sorghum is also a major host of the virus. Management Many commercial corn hybrids are highly tolerant of the disease and no control is needed; control aphid populations on plants and remove any Johnson grass growing in the vicinity as it can act as a reservoir for the virus.Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) or Corn Lethal Necrosis (CLN) Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus (MCMoV) + Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV)/ Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV)/Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV) Chlorotic mottling of entire leaf Chlorotic mottling which starts from base of leaf and extends towards tip Necrosis of leaf margin Young infected plant MLND infected leaf MLND infected plant Necrosis of leaf margin (2) Symptoms The disease occurs at all stages of crop.
The main symptoms includes appearance of chlorotic mottling on leaves which starts from base and extends upwards. Also the leaves shows necrosis at margins which later extends to mid rib and results in drying of entire leaf.The necrosis of young leaves in the whorl causes dead heart symptom.Other symptoms are premature plant death, shortened male inflorescences with few spikes, and/or shortened, malformed, partially filled ears.Cause Virus Comments The virus mainly spread by vectors (maize thrips, aphids, rootworms and leaf beetles) and infected seeds.The first report of this disease in Africa continent was in Kenya (2011).And later the disease spreads to other countries like Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.Management Use healthy, disease free certified seeds.Keep the fields free from weeds.Remove the infected plants and burn them.Control vectors by treating seed and/ foliar spray with suitable insecticide.Follow crop rotation with non cereals at least for two seasons.
Plant maize only in main rainy season instead of short rainy season. Grow available resistant varieties.Category : Oomycete Pythium root rot Pythium spp.Damping-off of seedlings caused by Pythium infection Symptoms Above-ground, plants may be yellow and stunted; roots have obvious lesions and roots are discolored; root cortex will come away when pulled gently, exposing the white stele; can also cause damping-off of seedlings.Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in soil and crop debris; disease emergence is favored by high soil moisture and low temperatures leading to low soil oxygen levels.Management Control of the disease relies on improving soil drainage or planting corn in areas where the soil is well-draining; systemic fungicides can be used to treat seed prior to planting to protect seedlings from disease.
Category : Other Slugs Various European brown snail (Cornu aspersum) Dusky slug (Arion subfuscus) Yellow-spotted slug (Limax flavus) Orange-banded slug (Arion fasciatus) Spanish slug (Arion lusitanicus) Gray garden slug (Deroceras reticulatum) damage symptoms Symptoms Irregularly shaped holes in leaves and stems; leaves may be shredded; slime trails present on rocks, walkways, soil and plant foliage; several slug species are common garden and field pests; slugs are dark gray to black in color and can range in size from 2.5 to 10 cm (1-4 in). Cause Mollusc Comments Slugs prefer moist, shaded habitats and will shelter in weeds or organic trash; adults may deposit eggs in the soil throughout the season; damage to plants can be extensive.
Management Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs and snails; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g. Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers.
Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Corn leaf aphid, Peach Aphid) Rhopalosiphum maidis Myzus persicae Aphids infestation Maize tassel infested with aphids Infestation of corn leaf aphids Corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) infestation on tassel Aphid infestation on maize Heavy aphid infestation and growth of sooty mold on corn Close-up view of the corn leaf aphid (Rhopalospiphum maidis). Aphids on maize tassel Symptoms Heavy infestations can result in curled leaves and stunted plants; honeydew secretions promote growth of sooty mold; corn leaf aphids are blue-green in color, peach aphids are green-yellow in color; aphids may transmit viruses when feeding.Cause Insects Comments Grassy weeds also serve as hosts for corn-leaf aphids; peach aphids have a wide host range.Management It is rare for aphids to reach levels that are damaging to the plant and no control is generally warranted as insecticide sprays will not prevent transmission of viruses.

Larvae feeding on sweetcorn tip Larva(e) feeding on leaf Corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) feeding on an ear of sweet corn.Leaf damage caused by corn earworm Corn earworm larva (Helicoverpa zea) near tip of an ear of field corn.Adult of Helicoverpa zea.Corn earworm feeding on ear Symptoms Feeding damage to leaves, tassel and leaf whorls; preferred feeding site is the ear and insect produces extensive excrement at the tip of the ear; younger larvae feed on silks, severing them from the plant; young caterpillars are cream- white in color with a black head and black hairs; older larvae may be yellow-green to almost black in color with fine white lines along their body and black spots at the base of hairs; eggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are initially creamy white but develop a brown-red ring after 24 hours and darken prior to hatching.
Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a pale green to tan, medium sized moth; can be a very damaging pests ofcorn; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil. Management Corn earworms are most problematic on sweet corn varieties and treatment should be applied at egg hatch; monitor plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations.Cutworms (Black cutworm, Variegated cutworm) Agrotis ipsilon Peridroma saucia Black cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon) adult Armyworm (Mythimna unipuncta) crawling on a corn leaf.They tend to hide down in the corn whorl.Young corn plant severed by cutworm Black cutworm larva (Agrotis ipsilon) lying next to the damage it caused to a young corn plant.
Black cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon) larvae may feed on young corn, and pull the stalk down into the ground from below. Damage shows up as gaps in the normal corn rows.Stalks may also be simply cut off and fall to the side.Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) feeding on corn Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed.
Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato. Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically.
Fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. 1.Leaf damage is usually characterized by ragged feeding, and moist sawdust-like frass near the funnels and upper leaves of the plant.2.Leaf damage is usually scattered in rows across the leaf 3.Younger larvae usually eat tissue from one side, leaving the other side in tact.This is what creates windows in the leaf 4.Deep feeding may may destroy maize tassels.5.
Caterpillars enter through the side of the ear and feed on developing kernels Cause Insects Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year. Management Organic methods of controlling the armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae.Flea beetles Chaetocnema pulicaria Altica spp.
Corn flea beetles corn flea beetle (Chaetocnema pulicaria) corn flea beetle feeding on leaf Flea beetle on corn leaf corn flea beetle (Chaetocnema pulicaria) adult Damaged corn foliage Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance. Cause Insects Comments Flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied. Thrips (Various spp.) Various Thrips damage on corn leaf The damaged plants with small, silver streaks on the leaves, and the plant looks as though it has been sandblasted.
Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves and may be distorted and curl upwards; edges of leaves may dry up and are speckled with black feces; insects are small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color. Cause Insects Comments May be found on corn at any time during the growing season.Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic; young plants will recover from damage and treatment is not often necessary as the thrips are beneficial for controlling mites.Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita M.arenaria M.javanica Root-knot nematode infected barley seedlings Root-knot nematode female and egg mass of the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne sp.
Symptoms Below ground we can see galls on the roots due to female nematode feeding. Above ground the plants are stunted, yellow and patchy in growth.Severely infested plant may die before harvest.Cause Nematode Comments The galls are formed by female nematode feeding resulting in formation of giant cells.Management Deep summer ploughing helps in reducing nematode population.Follow crop rotation with nematode antagonistic plants.Grow resistant varieties.In severely infected field follow soil fumigation with suitable nematicide.Category : Mites Spider mites (Various spp.) Various About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library Twospotted spider mite damage Tetranychus urticae infected plant Spider mite damage to a corn field -- plants in a treated (controlled) field on the left, damaged field on the right.Severe damage to corn plants due to an infestation of spider mites.

hirsutum accounts for approximately 90% of world wide cotton production today. Cotton plants possess a main stem giving rise to several branches at the top.The leaves of the plant are spirally arranged on the branches, have long petioles and have 3â€“5 triangular lobes.The plant produces a single flower on each axillary branch which can be red-purple, yellow or white in color and forms a leathery, oval seed capsule, or 'boll' which is 2â€“6 cm (0.8â€“2.4 in) long.Mature bolls will usually split open to reveal the characteristic white cotton fibers and the seed.The cotton plant can reach heights of 1â€“1.5 m (3.3â€“4.9 ft) and is usually cultivated as an annual, surviving only one growing season.Cotton may also be referred to as tree cotton and its center of origin is unknown although the plant has diversified from Mexico, north-east Africa and Arabia and Australia.
Cotton field ready for harvest Cotton field White cotton fibers Cotton Cotton boll Gossypium barbadense flower Cotton Content Gossypium hirsutum flower Cotton boll beginning to split open Cotton field Uses The major use of cotton today is in the textile industry, the fibers or 'lints' of the cotton plant are harvested and woven into fabric for the production of clothing, towels, bed sheets and many other textiles. Cotton fiber may also be used in the production of yarn and twine.The cotton seeds can be used to extract oil for use in the production of shortening or cooking oil and the manufacture of soaps and lubricants.The seed may be used as a feed for livestock.The fuzz produced as a byproduct of the ginning process can be used in the upholstery industry.Propagation Basic requirements Cotton is best grown in desert conditions using irrigation.
The seeds will germinate optimally at 34Â°C (93.2Â°F), while the seedlings requires a temperature between 24 and 29Â°C (75.2â€“84.2Â°F) to grow and develop properly. Cotton will grow on a variety of soils including sandy soil and heavy clay as long as it is water permeable and will grow optimally in a soil with a pH of 5.5â€“8.5.In addition cotton has a high tolerance for salt.Planting Cotton is propagated from seed by planting directly in a prepared field when growing conditions are favorable (suitable temperature, adequate rainfall etc).Cotton should only be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 18.3Â°C (65Â°F).Generally, seeds should be sown at a depth of 0.25 cm (1 in), with 3â€“6 seed sown in each hole.Ridging the soil is recommended as it helps to drain the plant in wet conditions and also to conserve water in dry conditions.Plant spacing depends on the variety but generally 20â€“100 cm (7.9â€“39.4 in) should be left between plants.
General care and maintenance The cotton field should be kept free from weeds and where the crop does not receive an adequate amount of water from rainfall, additional irrigation should be provided. Demand for nutrients is dependent on the type of soil on which the cotton is being grown.Cotton growing in acidic soils the plants will have a greater demand for nitrogen and phosphorus, whereas in sandy soil, potassium will be of greater importance.It is not recommended to grow cotton in the same field for more than three years and the crop should be rotated to prevent the build-up of diseases in the soil.Harvesting Cotton is still picked by hand in many areas of the world where the crop is grown.In the US cotton is machine harvested.Cotton in ready to harvest approximately 4 months after sowing when the bolls split open to reveal the white cotton fibers.
Fields are usually picked once every 3 to 4 weeks to prevent the fibers remaining in the field too long where they are susceptible to pests. The entire field is usually harvested with 2 to 3 pickings.Machine harvested cotton Machine harvest of cotton Women carry harvested cotton to be deseeded in Bukina Faso, Africa.Cotton harvesting in Madagascar Harvesting cotton by hand, India References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Daucus carota datasheet.Available at:http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/25791.[Accessed 17 November 14].Paid subscription required .Kirkpatrick, T.L.& Rothrock, C.S.(2001).Compendium of Cotton Diseases.American Phytopathological Society Press.Available at: http://www.apsnet.org/apsstore/shopapspress/Pages/42791.aspx.Available for purchase from APS Press .Ritchie, G.R., Bednarz, C.W., Jost, P.H.& Brown, S.M.(2004).Cotton Growth and Development.Cooperative Extension Service, University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.

Asochyta blight Asochyta gossypii Symptoms on lower leaf surface Symptoms of Asochyta blight on cotton foliage Damage to cotton seedling. Symptoms of Asochyta blight on cotton foliage Ascochyta blight of cotton Symptoms of Asochyta blight on cotton foliage Symptoms Brown or gray spots on leaves surrounded by a red halo; elongated red-purple cankers on stems cause the wilting and death of leaves above.Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by cool, wet weather.Management No fungicides are currently registered for use in cotton; plow crop debris into soil after harvest; crop rotation has little to no effect of control of disease.Cercospora leaf spot Cercospora gossypina Symptoms Circular red lesions on leaves which enlarge and turn white or gray in the center; lesions often have a pattern of concentric rings and possess a red margin; dark gray spore masses form in the centers of the lesions making them appear dark gray.
Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in crop debris from previous growing season; commonly found alongside Alternaria leaf spot and other foliar disease. Management Plow crop residue into the soil to reduce inoculum levels; provide plants with adequate irrigation and nutrients; applications of appropriate foliar fungicides may be required on susceptible cultivars.Fusarium wilt Fusarium oxysporum Infected plant Discoloration of vascular tissue caused by Fusarium wilt Discoloration of vascular tissue caused by Fusarium wilt Symptoms Wilting of cotyledons and seedling leaves; cotyledons become chlorotic at the edges and then necrotic; older plants exhibit symptoms of wilting and leaf chlorosis; wilting is usually gradual but may be pronounced after heavy summer rain; if infection is severe plants become stunted and may be killed; vascular system of infected plants becomes discolored and can be seen by cutting the stem.
Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by warm temperatures; fungus may be introduced to field through infected seed or by contaminated equipment and human movement. Management Use on certified, disease-free seed; plant varieties with higher resistance to the disease in areas with a history of Fusarium diseases; fumigating the soil may reduce disease incidence.Target spot Corynespora cassiicola Symptoms on infected leaf Infected leaf Circular to irregular spot with target markings Spots on infected leaves Corynespora leaf spot (Corynespora cassiicola) Target leaf spot Symptoms The symptoms can be found on leaves, boll bracts and on bolls.Initially the appearance of small chocolate brown spots which later enlarge to become circular to irregular spot with target markings.The symptoms are mainly seen in the lower canopy.Typically the infected leaves retain their green color or green yellow color.Under severe conditions leaf and flower drop may occur.
Cause Fungus Comments The pathogen also infects cucumber, sweet potato, soybean and tomato. It will cause severe loss if pathogen infect at flowering stage.The disease is common in Southeastern cotton producing states of USA.The target spot is confused with leaf spot caused by Cercospora spp.Stemphyllium spp.or Alternaria spp.But this spot is surrounded by reddish to purplish margin.Management Use available resistant varieties.Follow crop rotation.Spray suitable fungicide.Category : Bacterial Bacterial blight/angular leaf spot of cotton Xanthomonas axonopodis pv.malvacearum Earlier Xanthomonas citri ssp.
malvacearum Lower surface of infected leaf Angular leaf spot of cotton symptoms Symptoms Infected leaf Spots on infected leaf water soaked spot Symptoms Water-soaked spots on leaves which are delimited by leaf veins, giving them an angular appearance; lesions increase in size and turn black and necrotic; leaves drop from the plant; disease may also cause elongated gray-black lesions extending from the leaves to petioles and stem which are known as the "blackarm" phase; severe blackarm symptoms may cause the stem to be girdled; water-soaked lesions may be present on bolls; boll lesions enlarge and become sunken and brown-black in color. Cause Bacterium Comments Disease if often introduced to cotton fields by infested seeds.Management The use of resistant cotton varieties is the most effective method of controlling the disease; cultural practices such as plowing crop residue into soil after harvest can also limit disease emergence.

The cowpea plant is usually erect and possess ribbed stems and smooth trifoliate leaves which are arranged alternately on the stems.The plant produces clusters of flowers at the end of a peduncle (flower stalk) and 2â€“3 seed pods per peduncle.The seed pods are smooth, cylindrical and curved, reaching up to 35 cm (10 in) in length, with distinctive coloration, usually green, purple or yellow.As the seeds reach maturity the pod changes color to tan or brown.
The seeds can be white, cream, green, red brown or black in color or be a mottled combination. The seed may also possess an â€˜eyeâ€™ where a lighter color is surrounded by one that is darker.Cowpea can reach in excess of 80 cm (31.5 in) in height and, as an annual plant, lives for only one growing season before harvest.Cowpea may also be referred to as black-eyed pea, southern pea, crowder pea or field pea and originates from Africa.Field of cowpea Cowpea plants Cowpea flower Cowpea with pods Cowpea with pods Uses Cowpea Content Cowpea is an important grain legume in Africa, parts of the Americas and in Asia.The seeds can be consumed fresh along with the pods and leaves as a vegetable.Dried seeds are consumed after cooking.The plant can be used as a forage or for hay or silage.Cowpea may also be referred to as 'black-eyed pea' Propagation Basic requirements Cowpea is a warm season crop and thrives in hot, moist conditions.
Cowpeas have similar growth requirements to soybeans and should not be planted until until after the last frost and only when the soil temperature has reached 18.3Â°C (65Â°F) to prevent seeds rotting in the ground. The plants will be killed by frost.Cowpeas can be planted in a wide range of soils, from acidic (to pH 4) to neutral, as long as they are well-draining but the plants are not well adapted to alkaline soil.For best results,plant cowpeas in a well draining sandy loam with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 in an area that receives full sun.Cowpeas are drought resistant and very heat tolerant which means they can be grown successfully in many areas.Planting Cowpeas should be direct seeded when the soil temperature is consistently above 18.3Â°C (65Â°F).Seeds should be sown to a depth of 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) at a density of 4-8 plants per foot of row.An additional 76 cm (30 in) should be left between rows.
Seeds germinate quickly and the plants should produce pods in approximately 60 days. General care and maintenance Cowpea is fast growing and should quickly suppress any competing weeds.Some perennial grass species may colonize the spaces between rows and should be removed by cultivation.Cowpeas can grow in poor quality soils and do not require the addition of nitrogen fertilizers.In addition, the plants can grow a taproot which is often in excess of 2.4 m (8 ft) which allows the plant to access moisture deep down in the soil.This makes cowpea extremely resistant to drought, requiring little or no irrigation after the plants have become established.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Vigna unguiculata datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/56377.[Accessed 14 November 14].Paid subscription required .Schwartz, H.F., Steadman, J.R., Hall, R.& Forster, R.L.(2005) Compendium of Bean Diseases.

fuliginea only reported in India Management Plant resistant varieties if available; use adequate plant spacing to avoid overcrowding and promote good air circulation around plants Rhizoctonia seedling blight Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Water-soaked sunken, red-brown lesions on hypocotyls (germinating shoot below seed leaves) and epicotyls (shoot above seed leaves); small, circular brown spots on leaves; large irregular lesions with zonate banding on leaves; lesions with water-soaked borders; leaves that look like they are covered in sand (sclerotia) Cause Fungus Comments Can cause complete destruction of canopy Management Crop rotation helps to reduce the build up of the fungus in the soil; reduce soil compaction; do not plant seeds too deep Southern blight Sclerotium rolfsii Symptoms Sudden wilting of leaves; yellowing foliage; browning stem above and below soil; browning branches; stem may be covered with fan-like mycelial mat Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for long periods; disease emergence favored by high temperatures, high humidity and acidic soil; disease found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, including the southern United States Management Remove infected plants; avoid overcrowding plants to promote air circulation; rotate crops with less susceptible plants; plow crop debris deep into soil; provide a barrier to infection by wrapping lower stems of plant with aluminum foil covering below ground portion of stem and 2-3 in above soil line Category : Bacterial Bacterial blight Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms Water-soaked spots on leaves which enlarge and become necrotic; spots may be surrounded by a zone of yellow discoloration; lesions coalesce and give plant a burned appearance; leaves that die remain attached to plant; circular, sunken, red-brown lesion may be present on pods; pod lesions may ooze during humid conditions Cause Bacterium Comments Disease can be introduced by contaminated seed; bacteria overwinters in crop debris; disease emergence favored by warm temperatures; spread is greatest during humid, wet weather conditions Management Plant only certified seed; plant resistant varieties; treat seeds with an appropriate antibiotic prior to planting to kill off bacteria; spray plants with an appropriate protective copper based fungicide before appearance of symptoms Brown blotch Colletotrichum capsici Colletotrichum truncatum Symptoms Seeds not germinating; death of seedlings; post emergence symptoms include sunken oval lesions on stems, red-brown lesions on leaves, flowers aborting and/or mummified pods; severe defoliation can occur during prolonged periods of wet weather Cause Fungi Comments Disease particularly important in rainforest zone, southern Guinea savannas and the southernmost part of northern Guinea savannas Management The best method of controlling the fungus is to plant resistant varieties if available; plant only certified disease-free seed; practice good field sanitation such as removing crop debris from field after harvest to reduce levels of inoculum Soft stem rot Pythium aphanidermatum Symptoms Gary to green water-soaked rot girdling stem; plant death; white mycelial growth on stem during high humidity Cause Fungus Comments Important in warm, humid tropical conditions of southern Guinea, West Central Africa and subtropical India Management Plant in well-draining soils or raised bed to reduce soil moisture content; solarizing soil can help reduce levels of inoculum in the soil; soil drenches or seed treatment with appropriate fungicides can help to control the disease Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Cowpea aphid, Pea aphid, etc.) Aphis craccivora Acyrthosiphon pisum Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Armyworms (Beet armyworm, Western striped armyworm) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera praefica Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Corn earworm Helicoverpa zea Symptoms Larvae damage leaves, buds, flowers, pods and beans; young caterpillars are cream-white in color with a black head and black hairs; older larvae may be yellow-green to almost black in color with fine white lines along their body and black spots at the base of hairs; eggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are initially creamy white but develop a brown-red ring after 24 hours and darken prior to hatching Cause About Projects Team Blog Insect Comments Adult insect is a pale green to tan, medium sized moth; insect is also very damaging pests of corn; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil Management Monitor plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations Mexican bean beetle Epilachna varivestis Symptoms Irregular patches of feeding damage on underside of leaves which causes the top surface of the leaf to dry out, giving the leaves a lacy appearance; insect will also damage flowers and small pods; pods may be damaged so badly that they drop from the plant; adult insect is an orange-brown beetle with black spots; larvae are fat-bodied grubs which taper at the end and are in rows of conspicuous spines Cause Insect Comments Beetles can decimate bean crops; beetles overwinter as adults and undergo 2-3 generations per year Management Some bean varieties may be less attractive hosts for the beetle, e.g.
snapbeans are preferred hosts over lima beans; early varieties may escape damage form beetles beetle populations can be reduced by remove overwintering sites such as brush and leaves on the ground; handpick larvae and adults; brush eggs from leaves and destroy; apply insecticidal soap to leaf undersides if infestation is heavy Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.

The cranberry bush possesses a slender, wiry stems with small elliptical waxy evergreen leaves 7â€“10 mm (0.28â€“0.45 in) in length. The plant produces distinctive dark pink flowers with reflexed petals that leave the style and stamens exposed.The fruit is produced on the new plant growth produced that season and are initially white and ripen to dark red, waxy berries measuring 9â€“14 mm (0.4â€“0.6 in) in diameter.The cranberry plant can reach 5â€“20 cm (2.0â€“7.9 in) in height, with the vines stretching up to 2 m (6.6 ft) long.The cranberry may also be referred to as bearberry and originates from North America.Cranberry bog American cranberry foliage American cranberry flowers and fruit American cranberry flowers American cranberry Uses Cranberry Content Cranberries are usually processed into juice, sauce, jam and sweetened dried cranberries.They may also eaten raw.
Cranberries have long been used as a remedy to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, research has demonstrated the benefit to women, but the effect on other groups is less clear. Propagation Basic requirements Cranberries are wetland plants which grow best in bogs, swamps and poorly draining soils.The plants grow best in acidic, organic or sandy soils with a pH between 4.0 and 5.5 where there is a plentiful water supply.The bed should have a base material which is impermeable to water such as clay or peat.Commercially grown cranberries are grown in large beds surrounded by dykes that hold water in the beds when flooded for harvest.Cranberry is very susceptible to frost and flooding is also used to protect the plants along with sprinkler irrigation.This means that it is the water that will freeze and the resultant heat produced by the change of liquid to solid (latent heat of fusion) protects the plants from freezing themselves.
It is common for cranberry beds to be covered with up to 25 cm (9.8 in) of ice. Propagation Cranberries are usually propagated vegetatively by moving vines to a new bed.Cuttings are obtained as a by product of the practice of mowing the beds.Mowing helps to prevent the vines from becoming matted and leads to greater productivity by promoting new growth.Cuttings are pushed into a layer of fresh sand approximately 15 cm (5.9 in) deep and the sand is kept moist to allow the new vines to establish and produce new growth.Fruit will be produced on the new vine within 2â€“3 years and full productivity should be reached within 4 to 6 years of planting.Rooted plants are available for planting in home gardens and are less labor intensive option.General care and maintenance One of the most important aspects of caring for cranberry plants is to protect them from frosts.Growers use irrigation systems to help prevent damage and are able to flood the beds to protect the plants.
In the home garden, cranberry plants can be protected by covering with plastic sheets or blankets in the event of a frost. Cranberry beds should be kept moist through irrigation.Cranberries benefit from the addition of fertilizers with nitrogen being the most common requirement.Cranberries utilize nitrogen in the ammonium form as the lack the ability to reduce the nitrogen to nitrate.Phosphorous may also be required but should not be applied to the soil in excess amounts as acid soils bind large quantities of the element and it is unavailable to the plants.Harvest Cranberries can be dry or wet harvested.Berries are dry harvested with the use of a machine which combs berries from the plants.Wet harvesting of berries occurs in many major cranberry growing regions and involves flooding the beds and using machinery to remove the berries from the vines.
The beds are flooded with water sufficient to cover the vines and a piece of machine called a water reel, or â€œbeaterâ€​, is driven through the bed to displace the berries from the plants. More water is then added to the beds to allow the berries to float free from the plants and they are then moved with the use of booms to one corner of the bed where they are removed by conveyor belts or pumps for transport and processing.The berries are pumped from the bed for transporting Boons are used to move the berries to one corner of the bed Boons are used to move the berries to one corner of the bed Water is added to float the berries away from the plants Water is added to float the berries away from the plants Machinery is driven through flooded beds to 'pick' the cranberries References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Vaccinium macrocarpon datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/56008.[Accessed 18 November 14].Paid subscription required .Caruso, F.

Symptoms Discrete patches in a bed which are devoid of vines; other symptoms of disease include: weak and unproductive vines; stunted shoots; small leaves which turn red prematurely in the Fall; reduced flower and fruit production; olive green to dark brown discoloration of root tissue under periderm Cause Oomycete Comments Disease is most severe in water logged or poorly drained soils Management Control of the disease is most effective when an integrated management strategy is implemented, control strategies include: managing water to avoid water saturated soil; increasing soil drainage through digging of ditches or installing drains; stimulating root production and plant growth by fertilizing, particularly unproductive plants; application of appropriate fungicides if available Pests Category : Insects Blackheaded fireworm Rhopobota naevana Symptoms Several leaves webbed together at growing tips of fresh growth; insects feed on lower leaf surface, creating holes which remain covered by the upper leaf surface; upper leaf surface turns red-brown and dies; insect may also wound fruit and encourage secondary infections with fungi and/or bacteria; adult insect is a gray-brown moth; larvae are cream to gray- green caterpillars shiny dark brown or black head Cause Insect Comments Insect overwinters as eggs on the foliage; insect typically undergoes 2 generations per year but there may be a third generation in warmer years when there is an early spring; insect can cause substantial damage if populations are left unchecked Management Reflooding the beds for between 24 and 48 hours after eggs have hatched will kill off a high number of larvae; application of Bacillus thurengiensis may reduce the populations of larvae on the plants Cottonball Monilinia oxycocci Symptoms Tip blight on new shoots (shriveled tip resembles a shepherd's crook); masses of white powdery spores on tips just before plant bloom; brown V- or U-shaped lesions on leaf midveins Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in dried up remains of fruit Management Primary method of controlling cottonball is the application of appropriate fungicides if available; cultural practices that reduce incidence of the disease have not yet been investigated Cranberry blossomworm Epiglaea apiata Cranberry blossomworm larva Cranberry blossomworm - adult moth Symptoms Feeding damage to leaves; holes bored in buds; buds and blossoms dropping from plant; adult insect is a dark brown moth; young larvae are green caterpillars which turn reddish-brown sa they mature Cause Insect Comments Insect overwinters as eggs on crop debris in the soil; blossomworms undergo one generation per year Management Insectide application is recommended for commercial production if the number of blossomworm larvae reaches the threshold of 4.5 larvae per 25 sweep net samples (sweep netting must be done at night as the insect is nocturnal); Cranberry fruitworm Acrobasis vaccinii Cranberry fruitworm (berry pictured is blueberry) Symptoms Berries turning red prematurely; fruit shriveling and drying up; fruit is hollowed out and filled with insect frass; entry and exit holes may be visible on the berry - exit holes are significantly larger than entry holes; adult insect is a gray-brown moth which lays its eggs near the calyx end of the berry; newly hatched larvae are very small and are pale yellow in color; larvae are the damaging stage and they burrow into the berries to consume the pulp inside Cause Insect Comments One fruitworm larva can consume 3 to 8 berries prior to pupation; insect undergoes only one generation per year; insect is also a pest of blueberry Management Predation by natural enemies does occur but is not enough to keep the cranberry fruitworm under control; late flooding of the cranberry plantation (30 day reflood before the end of dormancy) has een shown to successfully reduce the activity of the fruitworm; chemical control option include several broad spectrum insecticides for commercial use but must be applied at the egg stage in order to be effective as larvae which have already entered the fruit are shielded from the chemical Cranberry tipworm Dasineura oxycoccana Symptoms Cupping and whitening of terminal leaves; death of growing tips of plants; plants will compensate by creating a new branch at a lateral bud, these new branches may produce only vegetative growth and no fruit, resulting in reduced yield the following year; adult insect is a tiny (2 mm) fly which only lives a few days; larvae are maggots which are initially clear but change to white and finally orange as they mature Cause Insect Comments Damage from the insect is most apparent the year following attack in the form of reduced yield; the fly can undergoe between 3 and 5 generations per year Management Because cranberry tipworm larvae and adults are so small, they are difficult to monitor; sanding the cranberry bushes is an effective method of controlling insect emergence as it prevent that adults emerging from pupae in the soil; sanding should be conducted on continuous blocks as there is potential for the insect to recolonize from unsanded areas; natural enemies include hoverflies and some species of parasitic wasp Cranberry weevil Anthonomus musculus Symptoms Flowers are orange instead of pink due to feeding damage and do not produce fruit; numerous holes in berries; feeding damage to underside of leaves results in small black crescent-shaped spots; damage to the base of runners by adult insect may cause damage similar to frost; adult insect is a reddish brown beetle with elongated snout; larvae are yellow- white grubs Cause Insect Comments Weevils overwinter as adults under the winter flooded beds; the insect undergoes only one generation per year Management Cranberry weevil populations usually remain low and little is known about their natural enemies and cultural control methods; chemicals registered for use in commercial plantations on the East coast of the US include azinphosmethyl and chlorpyrifos which should be applied if weevil population has reached the threshold (on average 4.5 weevils per 25 sweep net samples) Gypsy moth Lymantria dispar Gypsy moth larva Symptoms Feeding damage to cranberry foliage and terminal buds and new growth;

Garden cress is a fast growing plant with many branches and narrow, oval leaves. The plant produces small pink to white flower which are 2 mm (1/12 in) in diameter and form a highly clustered inflorescence.It can reach a height of 60 cm (23.6 in) and although classed as an annual it can behave as a perennial as it may drop seeds before harvest that will grow the next year.Garden cress may also be referred to as pepper cress or Persian broadleaf cress and it originates from Persia (Iran).Cress flowers Cress flowers Cress Cress leaves Garden cress plants Potted cress plants Uses The shoots and leaves of garden cress are used as a salad green or seasoning as they has a peppery taste.The seeds may also be ground and used as a seasoning.Cress Content Propagation Basic requirements Garden cress is a cool season annual and can grow in almost any type of soil as long as it is moist and rich in nutrients.Cress will grow best in a well-draining loam soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.7.
The plants should be grown in full sun or partial shade in areas where temperatures get very high. Cress plants will tolerate some frost.Planting Garden cress is propagated by seed and can be sown as soon as the soil is workable in the Spring.The seeds are sown either by broadcasting or arranging the plants in rows.Rows should be spaced 7-10 cm (3-4 in) apart.The seeds should be covered with a light layer of soil and kept moist.Cress will germinate in 2 to 7 days and the plants do not usually require thinning.The plants will grow best if the soil is kept moist.General care and maintenance Cress is very easy to grow and care for.The plants will grow best if kept moist so the plants should be watered regularly.Keep beds weed free to prevent competition with the developing plants.Due to its short growing period, cress has a low fertilizer requirement.Container grown plants can be fertilized with a liquid fertilizer if required.
Harvesting Cress can be harvested 2 to 3 weeks after the seedlings emerge once the leaves have reached 3 cm (2 in) in length. Harvest older plants first by snipping with a pair of scissors and leave the younger ones to develop fully.References Anderson, C.R.(1995).Garden Cress.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture Home Gardening Series.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-6084.pdf.[Accessed 19 November 14].Free to access .Allan, B.& Drost, D.(2010).Garden Cress in the Garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HG_Garden_2006-05.pdf.[Accessed 19 November 14].Free to access .

Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insect Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Cucumber, Cucumis sativus , is a warm season, vining, annual plant in the family Cucurbitaceae grown for its edible cucumber fruit.
The cucumber plant is a sprawling vine with large leaves and curling tendrils. The plant may have 4 or 5 main stems from which the tendrils branch.The leaves of the plant are arranged alternately on the vines, have 3â€“7 pointed lobes and are hairy.The cucumber plant produces yellow flowers that are 4 cm (1.6 in) in diameter.The cucumber fruit varies in shape but is generally a curved cylinder rounded at both ends that can reach up to 60 cm (24 in) in length 10 cm (3.9 in) in diameter.Cucumber plants are annual plants, surviving only one growing season and the vines can reach up to 5 m (16.4 ft) in length.Cucumber may also be referred to as gherkin and originates from the foothills of the Himalayas, likely in India.Cucumbers beginning to develop from flower Close-up cucumber flower Cucumber flower Cucumber foliage Cucumber fruit Cucumber fruit on the vine Uses Cucumber Content Although technically a fruit, cucumbers are used as a fresh vegetable, consumed fresh in salads.
Some varieties are grown specifically for pickling. Yellow varieties are generally cooked before consumption.Propagation Basic requirements Cucumbers require warm, dry conditions to develop optimally, preferring both warm days and warm nights and growing best at a temperature of 30Â°C (86Â°F).Cucumbers will yield best if grown in a fertile, well- draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.Cucumbers are very sensitive to cold and should be planted in full sun and provided with ample soil moisture due to their shallow root system.Cucumber varieties One of the biggest considerations when choosing a cucumber variety is whether or not it requires pollinating.Many newer cucumber varieties are gynoecious which means that they produce only, or mostly, female flowers.Some gynoecious varieties require pollinating with male flowers, in which case a proportion of the seeds in the packet will be pollinator plants which produce the male flowers.
Some gynoecious varieties are parthenocarpic which means that they do not need the male plants to produce fruit. These types are recommended for growing in glasshouses as they do not require the presence of insect pollinators.Sowing seeds Direct seeding is the preferred method for sowing cucumbers as they do not transplant well.Seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 15.6Â°C (60Â°F).Sow seeds 1.3â€“2.5 cm (0.5â€“1.0 in) deep, thinning to a spacing of at least 30 cm (12 in) between plants after germination.Cucumbers can also be seeded on hills or mounds of soil to encourage warm soil and better drainage.In this instance, seeds should be sown on hills in groups of 4â€“6 seeds, allowing 1.2 m (4 ft) between each group in all directions.After emergence, thin the seedlings to 1 or 2 plants per hill.Cucumber seeds should germinate in 4â€“13 days depending on the soil temperature.
General care and maintenance Cucumber vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow. Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence.Providing burpless varieties with vertical support allows the fruits to hang loose and grow straight.Cucumbers also require a continuous supply of water and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water.Shallow watering or watering less frequently will reduce fruit yields.Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black plastic mulch has the advantage of warming the soil.Harvesting Cucumbers should be harvested from the plant when they are still immature and green in color.Mature fruits are yellow and the flesh is often tough with woody seeds.The size of cucumbers at harvest depends on the variety of the cucumber being grown and what it is to be used for.
Cucumbers for pickling are generally picked when they are less than 5 cm (2 in) long whereas burpless cucumbers for slicing should be allowed to reach approximately 4 cm (~1.5 in) in diameter. It is important to remove any fruits nearing maturity to ensure the plant remains productive.Their rapid growth means that cucumbers may need harvested every couple of days.Cucumber growing vertically in cage Cucumber trellis Vertical support allows the fruits to hang loose and grow straight Cucumber seedlings with balck plastic mulch and trellis Cucumber seedlings should emerge in 4â€“13 days References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Cucumis sativus datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/16967.[Accessed 19 November 14].Paid subscription required .Coolong, T.(2010).Cucumber.University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service.Availabel at: http://www.uky.edu/Ag/NewCrops/introsheets/cucumber.pdf.[Accessed 19 November 14].Free to access .Lerner, B.R.& Dana, M.N.(2001).

These spots spread very fast to a large portion of fruit resulting in soft and necrotic area.If the condition is favorable, heavy growth of white fungal mass which resembles the tufts of cotton can be seen on infected area.Cause Fungus Comments The disease is favored by wet condition.The pathogen spreads via water and soil particles.Management Avoid excessive soil moisture.Mulching with suitable materials help in preventing the disease.Category : Bacterial, Fungal Scab Cladosponum cucumerinum Damaged fruit Symptoms on leaf Symptoms on leaves, partial and stem Scab symptoms on cucumber Infected fruits Infected fruit Stem lesion with fungal sporulation Symptoms The leaves exhibit small water-soaked or pale green spots which later turn white to gray and become angular.
A yellowish halo may surround the lesion. The damaged leaves may appear ragged due to tearing and cracking of dead tissue.Symptoms can also be seen on petiole and stem.On fruits, the appearance of small, gray, slightly sunken, oozing, gummy spots which later enlarge, and finally become distinct sunken cavities.Under favorable condition, the pathogen produces dark, olive green, velvety layer of spores on the cavities.Cause Fungus Comments The pathogen overwinters on the seed, in crop debris and in soil.Management Remove and destroy the infected leaves and plant debris.Keep the field free from weeds.Use disease free seeds.Grow available resistant varieties.Follow crop rotation.Spray with suitable fungicides.
Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Peach aphid, Melon aphid) Myzus persicae Aphis gossypii Aphis gossypii Wingless form of Myzus persicae aphid on squash leaf Winged form of Myzus persicae aphid on squash leaf Infestation of Myzus persicae on lower surface of leaf Larvae of lady bird beetle feeding on aphid Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants. Cause Insects Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use. Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper adult cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) larvae Cabbage Looper cocoon with pupa Later stage larvae Cocoon and pupa of the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) from which the moth has emerged.
Cabbage Looper Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color. Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range.Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully.
Cucumber beetles (Western striped cucumber beetle, Western spotted cucumber beetle, Banded cucumber beetle) Acalymma vittata Diabrotica undecimpunctata Diabrotica balteata Banded cucumber beetle striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) Banded cucumber beetle Banded cucumber beetle feeding on leaf Striped cucumber beetles and checkered melon beetle feeding on ripe muskmelon Western spotted cucumber beetle The spotted cucumber beetle Adult striped cucumber beetle Western striped cucumber beetle Symptoms Stunted seedling; damaged leaves, stems and/or petioles; reduced plant stand; plants may exhibit symptoms of bacterial wilt; scars on fruit caused by beetle feeding damage; adult beetles are brightly colored with either a green- yellow background and black spots or alternating black and yellow stripes. Cause Insect Comments Beetles overwinter in soil and leaf litter and emerge from soil when temperatures begin to reach and exceed 12.7Â°C (55Â°F).
Management Monitor new planting regularly for signs of beetle; floating row covers can be used to protect the plants from damage but will need to be removed at bloom to allow bees to pollinate plants; applications of kaolin clay can be effective for management of small beetle populations; application of appropriate insecticides may be necessary. Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm adult insect Larva feeding on leaf bronzed cutworm (Nephelodes minians) adult Cutworm feeding on leaves Bronzed cutworm larvae Cutworm severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed. Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato.
Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically. Flea beetles Epitrix spp.
potato flea beetle (Epitrix cucumeris) injury to potato leaf copper leafy spurge flea beetle (Aphthona flava) Tobacco flea beetle (Epitrix hirtipennis) Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance. Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied.
Stinkbugs (Various) Various Stink bug on cucumber leaf southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula) Stink bug Symptoms Dark colored pinpricks on fruit surrounded by a lighter area that turns yellow or remains light green; stink bugs often carry pathogens in their mouthparts which can cause secondary infections and decay of fruit; adult insect is shield- shaped and brown or green in color; may have pink, red or yellow markings; eggs are drum shaped and laid in clusters on the leaves; larvae resemble the adults but are smaller. Cause Insect Comments Adult insects overwinter under leaves, on legumes, blackberries or on certain weeds such as mustard or Russian thistle.
Management Remove weeds around crop which may act as overwintering sites for stink bugs and practice good weed management throughout the year; organically accepted control methods include the use of insecticidal soaps, kaolin clay and preservation of natural enemies; chemical treatments are not recommended for tomatoes that are to be processed for paste or canning unless secondary infections with other pathogens are a concern. Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Smaller, tan thrips on left is the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci).Larger yellowish thrips on the right is the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis).Thrips damage on cucumber leaves: Frankliniella occidentalis with coarser pattern (left); Thrips tabaci on right, for comparison.First instar nymph of onion thrips (Thrips tabaci).

The trunk of the tree is covered in upward-pointing, overlapping, woody leaf bases and terminates in a crown of 20â€“30 leaves.The leaves are feather-like with spiny petioles and thick midrib.The leaf blades are pinnately divided and are blue- green in color.The uppermost leaves of the crown stand more erect while the lower ones droop and recurve toward the trunk.
The tree produces small, fragrant cream-white flowers and the inflorescence may possess as many as 10,000 flowers. The fruits are produced in clusters and are oblong to ovoid berries with single stones and red-brown flesh.Date palms can grow to a height of 30 m (98 ft) and can live for up to 150 years, although they are usually replaced in commercial plantations when their productivity begins to decline.The date palm is believed to originate from Western Asia.Date cluster Dates Date palm Red dates Date palm Date palm with clusters of dates Uses Dates Content Dates are consumed as a fresh or dry fruit.They are considered a staple in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.The fruit may also be used to make juice concentrates, fermented products (e.g.wines) or pastes for use in baking and confection.
Dates for sale at a bazaar in Morocco Propagation Basic requirements Date palms grow best in semi-arid climates close to water bodies such as rivers or oases, with an annual average temperature of 12â€“27Â°C (53.6â€“80.6Â°F) in regions where there is a long hot summer and mild winter. A mean temperature of 21â€“30Â°C (69.8â€“86Â°F) for at least one month is necessary for fruit production in addition to a period of no rainfall during flowering to prevent damage to the flowers.Date palms grow well in a wide range of soils provided they are well-draining, have a pH between 5.2 and 8 and are in close proximity to a body of water.Fruit production is highest when grown in sandy loams.Propagation Date palms for commercial cultivation are usually propagated from suckers removed from the base of mature trees to allows desirable characteristics to be maintained.The suckers should be between 3 and 6 years old and are separated from the mother along with some root.
Separating of suckers is usually carried out in late summer of Fall. The newly detached suckers are planted to a depth of 80 cm (31.5 in) leaving 9â€“10 m (30â€“33 ft) between plants.The newly planted suckers should be watered daily for the first week to aid in establishment and once weekly thereafter.Pollination Date palms are protandric which means that the male flowers are produced before the females.In order for successful pollination to be guaranteed, commercial date palms are pollinated by hand or with the use of machinery.Hand pollination is achieved by cutting the male inflorescence from the palm and joining strands to the female inflorescence.Alternatively, the pollen is extracted and mixed with flour and the mixture is then applied mechanically to the female flowers.Mechanical pollination is conducted with the aid of a small insecticide duster known as a â€˜pufferâ€™.
General care and maintenance Date development is aided by removing dead leaves and thorns from the trees, thinning of fruit and bunches and also the removal of bunches if the number per palm is too high. Allowing palms to over produce will reduce yield the following year.Each of these practices also aims to maximize fruit size and promote regular fruit production.When bunches begin to develop, they are pulled down and tied to lower leaves in order to protect them from damage from wind.Dates require dry and hot conditions to ripen in combination with the large amount of irrigation of the soil.Harvesting Harvesting of ripe dates requires reaching the top of the palm tree.This is achieved through the use of ladders which may be permanently fixed to the tree or through the use of machinery that can raise the worker on a platform.In the Northern Hemisphere, harvest begins at the end of the summer into early Fall and ends around November depending on the variety.
Some varieties continue to be harvested after the onset of the rainy season but rain can damage the fruit and reduce its quality so the fruits are usually protected with the use of waxed paper or nylon sleeves.

Dill is a very aromatic plant with an erect growth habit. It possess branching stems and fine, soft, fibre-like leaves which are arranged into an open cone and are blue-green in color.The plant produces yellow flowers on umbels which can be up to 16 cm (6 in) in diameter.Dill can grow up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in height and is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season.Dill may also be referred to as garden dill and its origin is no known, although it is believed to be native to the Mediterranean.Dill foliage Young dill plant Dill seedhead Dill cultivation in Montana, USA Dill stem and flowerhead Dill flower umbels Dill flower umbels Dill flower umbels Dill foliage Dill Content Uses Dill leaves are used fresh or dry as a culinary herb.The leaves may be used to make tea.The seeds of the plant may be used as a spice.Propagation Basic requirements Dill grows best in full sun in temperatures averaging 16â€“18Â°C (601â€“64Â°F).
Dill can be grown in a range of soils but the plants will grow optimally in well-draining sandy loam which is rich in organic matter and has a pH between 5.6 and 6.5. Dill should be planted in an area that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight every day and that is sheltered from strong winds which can easily damage the hollow stalks of the plant.Planting Dill does not transplant well and it is therefore recommended to direct seed.Seeds should be planted in early Spring after all danger of frost has passed.Sow seeds 1.9 to 2.5 cm (0.75 to 1.0 in) deep, allowing 30 to 38 cm (12-15 in) between plants and 45 cm (18 in) between rows.It is common for dill to be grown between other plants such as onions.Stagger plantings by 2 to 3 weeks for a continuous harvest.Seeds usually germinate within 7 to 21 days depending on the soil temperature.
General care and maintenance Dill is a hardy plant and can tolerate temperatures down to -3.8Â°C (25Â°F) once established, Dill plants require little water, usually irrigating once or twice a week is sufficient and one light application of fertilizer late in the Spring should be enough to sustain the plant for the entire growing season. If the plant is not sufficiently sheltered from wind, the plants will benefit from staking to prevent the hollow stems from snapping.Harvesting Dill is ready to harvest approximately 90 days after planting.Foliage can be harvested anytime but is most flavorsome just before flowering.To harvest the leaves simply cut the leaves at the stem or cut the stem a few inches from the soil line.Seedheads should be harvested 2-3 weeks after bloom before the seeds begin to change color.The seedheads can be hung up to finish drying.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Anethum graveolens datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/3472.

The plants has a branching stem and simple, long, flat. coarsely lobed leaves which are green in color and are arranged alternately on the branches.The leaves can measure 10 to 20 cm (4â€“8 in) long and 5 to 10 cm (2â€“4 in) broad.The plant produces purple flowers which are 3â€“5 cm (1.2â€“2.0 in) in diameter.The fruit is a large, fleshy ovoid berry which can reach 40 cm (15.7 in) in length, with glossy smooth skin and numerous small seeds.The color of the fruit is variable and can be white, green, yellow, purple or black.Eggplants can reach up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in height and although they are perennial plants, they are most commonly grown as annuals.Eggplant may also be referred to as aubergine or guinea squash and originates from the Indian subcontinent.Different eggplant varieties Eggplant flower bud Eggplant flower Eggplant Eggplant Eggplant Uses Eggplant is usually cooked before consumption and is eaten as a vegetable.
Eggplant Content Propagation Basic requirements Eggplants are warm-season crops which require a long growing season.They grow best in regions where the daytime temperature is between 26 and 32Â°C (80â€“90Â°F) and night time temperatures around 21Â°C (70Â°F). In addition, eggplant is a sun loving plant and should be positioned in an area that receives full sunlight.Plants will perform best when planted in a fertile soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.8.Sowing seeds In cold areas and regions with a short growing season it is necessary to start eggplant indoors or in a glasshouse.In addition, eggplant will often perform much better in colder areas if planted in containers or grown under row covers as this helps to keep the soil warm.Seeds should be sown indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost date.Sow seeds thickly in seed trays containing good quality sterile seed starting mix to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in).
Keep the trays moist and provide bottom heat by placing on a heat mat or in a warm area of the house. Seedling should be potted into larger pots when they have two sets of true leaves.Transplanting Eggplant seedlings can be transplanted after hardening-off and when all danger of frost has passed in your area.Seedlings should be spaced 45â€“60 cm (18â€“24 in) apart, depending on variety, allowing a further 60â€“90 cm (24â€“36 in) between rows.General care and maintenance Eggplant may benefit from the addition of mulch to conserve soil moisture and maintain a higher soil temperature.Row covers will help to increase the temperature around the plants in cooler climates and during cool spells in otherwise warm areas.The row covers should be removed to allow pollinators to access the plants during flowering.Eggplant should be provided with a steady water supply for optimum development of fruit and the soil around the plants should not be allowed to dry out but should also not be wet.
Plants can be laden with numerous fruit and the use of stakes and supports can help to support the plants before harvest. Harvesting Eggplant fruits are ready to harvest while the flesh is still firm and seeds are small and tightly packed.The skin of the fruit should be firm, glossy and dark purple.Over ripe fruit will contain darker seeds and will taste bitter.Harvest the fruit as soon as it is ripe to ensure maximum productivity.The fruit should be removed from the plant by cutting the calyx (green stem above the fruit) with a sharp knife.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Solanum melongena datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/50536.[Accessed 24 November 14].Paid subscription required .Rowell, B.(2006).Revised.Eggplant.University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://www.uky.edu/Ag/NewCrops/introsheets/eggplant.pdf.[Accessed 24 November 14].
Free to access Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Other Blossom-end rot n/a Symptoms Small water-soaked area on end of fruit where the blossom was occurring on unripe fruit; lesion enlarges and turns sunken, black and leathery in appearance. Cause Physiological disorder Comments Caused by low calcium concentration in fruit; may result from competition from other competitive ions in soil e.g.potassium, drought stress; fluctuations in soil moisture or application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer which promotes rapid vegetative growth.Management Maintain soil pH at 6.5; lime soil to increase the concentration of calcium in soil and decrease competition with other ions; use mulch to reduce drought stress; avoid ammonium fertilizers as they may increase competition with calcium by increasing ammonium ions in soil, use nitrate instead; avoid over fertilizing.

Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features of aphids include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the insect's body; aphids will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; aphids may also transmit plant viruses to the plant when they feed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Colorado potato beetle nymphs and damage to eggplant Colorado potato beetle nymphs feeding on eggplant leaf Colorado potato beetle on eggplant leaf Symptoms Feeding damage to foliage; if infestation is severe or if left untreated plants can be completely defoliated; adult insect is a black and yellow striped beetle; larvae are bright red with black heads when they first hatch and change color to pink; larvae have two rows of black spots. Cause Insect Comments Adult beetles emerge in spring; female beetles lay eggs in batches of up to two dozen; eggs are orange-yellow and are laid on undersides of leaves; a female can lay 500 or more eggs over a four to five week period.
Management Control of Colorado potato beetle can be challenging as they have developed high levels of insecticide resistance; in the home garden planting early maturing varieties of potato allows the plants to escape from most damage; adults and larvae should be hand picked from plants and destroyed in soapy water; applications of Bacillus thuringiensis can be effective at controlling larvae but should be applied frequently; some insecticides, including spinosad, are still effective against adult beetles. Cutworms Various species including: Agrotis spp.Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians etc.
Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but are usually dirty gray or brown to black with dark spots or lines and will curl up into a characteristic C-shape when disturbed Cause Insect Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Flea beetles Epitrix fuscula Epitrix hirtipennis Flea beetle damage to eggplant foliage Flea beetle damage to eggplant foliage Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; feeding damage may also occur on the fruit; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insect Comments Flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Hornworms (Tomato hornworm, Tobacco hornworm) Manduca quinquemaculata Manduca sexta Tomato hornworm and damage on eggplant Symptoms Feeding damage to leaves or leaves stripped from plant; heavy infestation may result in damage to fruit appearing as large open scars; large green caterpillars may be spotted on plant; caterpillars may reach in excess of 7.5 cm (3 in) in length and possess a spike at the end of their body; most common species have 7 diagonal stripes on sides or 8 v-shaped markings on each side; single eggs may be present on leaves and measure approx 1.3 mm in diameter; eggs are in initially light green in color and turn white prior to hatching Cause Insect Comments Insect overwinters as pupa in soil; typically undergoes 2 generations per year; heavy infestations are more common in warm areas Management Hand pick larvae from plants leaving any parasitized larvae behind to promote populations of natural enemies (these larvae can be distinguished by the presence of white, oblong-shaped cocoons on their backs); sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis are organically acceptable and highly effective Stinkbugs (Various) Various Symptoms Dark colored pinpricks on fruit surrounded by a lighter area that turns yellow or remains light green; stink bugs often carry pathogens in their mouthparts which can cause secondary infections and decay of fruit; adult insect is shield- shaped and brown or green in color; may have pink, red or yellow markings; eggs are drum shaped and laid in clusters on the leaves; larvae resemble the adults but are smaller Cause Insect Comments Several types of stink bug can cause damage to tomatoes; adult insects overwinter under leaves, on legumes, blackberries or on certain weeds such as mustard or Russian thistle Management Remove weeds around crop which may act as overwintering sites for stink bugs and practice good weed management throughout the year; organically accepted control methods include the use of insecticidal soaps, kaolin clay and preservation of natural enemies; chemical treatments are not recommended for tomatoes that are to be processed for paste or canning unless secondary infections with other pathogens are a concern Category : Mites Mites (Carmine mite, Two-spotted spider mite) Tetranychus cinnabarinus Tetranychus urticae Spider mite damage to eggplant leaves Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Endive, Cichorium endivia , is an annual or biennial herbaceous plant in the family Asteraceae grown as a salad green.
The plant is a short stemmed herb with a rosette of leaves which are arranged alternately on the stem. The leaves become smaller toward the top of the stem The leaves can be broad and flat, curly or frizzy depending in the variety and are generally 10â€“25 cm (3.9â€“9.8 in) in length.The endive plant produces an inflorescence consisting of 1â€“3 blue flowers.Endive plants can grow to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in height and are typically grown as an annual with only one growing season.Endive may also be referred to as Ceylon spinach, escarole or chicory and originates from the Mediterranean.A frizzy variety of endive Uses Endive leaves are eaten fresh as a salad green.Propagation Basicl requirements Endive is a cool season plant and grows best in short days and cool temperatures.The optimum Endive Content temperature for the plants growth is between 15 and 18Â°C (59â€“64.4Â°F).
The plants will grow best in a loose, fertile soil or well draining loam with a pH of 6.5â€“7.8 and should be positioned in full sun or partial shade. Endive will tolerate light frost and harvesting after frost will improve the flavor of the leaves.Growing from seed Endive can be direct seeded or started indoors to produce transplants.Seeds germinate at temperatures between 1.7 and 29.4Â°C (35â€“85Â°F), with 23.8Â°C (75Â°F) being optimal.Seeds should be sown to a depth of 0.6 cm (0.25 in) in high quality potting soil or, if direct seeding, a finely prepared bed.Seeds can be sown outdoors 2 to 4 weeks before the last frost date.Sow seeds 5â€“10 cm (2â€“4 in) apart, leaving approximately 45 cm (18 in) between rows.General care and maintenance Endive is prone to bolting in warm weather.If the temperature rises above 24Â°C (75Â°F) then care should be taken to keep the plants well watered and shaded from strong sunlight.
About a week before harvest, the outer leaves of heading varieties should be tied up around the head to blanch the plant to prevent it developing a bitter flavor. The plants can also be blanches by covering the entire plant with a pot or box to exclude light.Harvest The entire head should be cut at ground level after blanching using a sharp knife.Harvest the plants early if very hot weather or a hard frost is expected.References Anderson, C.R.Endive-Escarole.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-6068.pdf.[Accessed 01 December 14].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Cichorium endivia datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13408.[Accessed 01 December 14].Paid subscription required .

Flea beetles and damage Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insect Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Leafminers Liriomyza spp Typical leafminer damage Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larave hatch and feed on leaf interior Cause Insect Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies Loopers (Cabbage looper, Alfalfa looper) Trichoplusia ni Autographa californica About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Cabbage looper Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Fennel, Foeniculum vulgare , is an herbaceous perennial plant in the family Apiaceae grown for use as a herb or flavoring.
The fennel plant is an erect herb with 4â€“5 hollow stems and distinctly divided feathery foliage. The leaves are simple and linear and are 2â€“15 cm in length.The plant produces flowers on flat umbels which can be 20 cm (7.9 in) in diameter and possess 20-50 tiny yellow flowers.The plant may reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in height.Fennel is a short-lived plant and is almost always grown as an annual.Fennel may also be referred to as wild fennel or sweet fennel depending on variety and originates from southern Europe and the Mediterranean.Fennel flower umbel Fennel Fennel stems and flowers Fennel flowering Fennel bulb Fennel flower bud Fennel flowerheads Feathery foliage of the fennel plant Fennel plant Fennel Content Uses Fennel leaves can be used fresh or dried as a spice in cooking.The bulb of some varieties is also edible and is usually consumed after cooking.The seeds can be dried and used as a spice.
Propagation Basic requirements Fennel is a perennial plant which is commonly grown as an annual. It grows best in cool weather at temperatures between 21 and 24Â°C (70â€“75Â°F).Hotter temperatures tend to induce bolting.Fennel will grow best if grown in full sun in a well draining, fertile loam soil with a pH between 6.3 and 8.3.Planting Fennel is usually propagated directly from seed and requires and ambient temperature between 15 and 20Â°C (59â€“68Â°F) to germinate.It should be planted in early Spring or Fall when temperatures are suitable.Seed should be sown at a depth of 1â€“3 cm (0.4â€“1.2 in) leaving 15â€“50 cm (5.9â€“19.7 in) between plants and 60 cm (24 in) between rows.General care and maintenance Fennel should be kept free from weeds which will easily out compete the plant for light and nutrients.
Plants will benefit from the addition of nitrogen fertilizer but care should be taken not to overfeed the plants as it will result in a disproportionate amount of vegetative mass developing. Fennel should be provided with regular irrigation to prevent the stalks from splitting.Harvesting Fennel stalks should be cut just before flowering.Stalks are usually ready for harvest between 5 and 7 months after planting.Seed heads should be collected promptly before they shatter.The seed heads are ready to harvest when they turn brown in color.Once the stalks have been harvested, the bulb can also be cleaned and stored.References Anderson, C.R.Fennel.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Avaialble at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/FSA-6083.pdf.[Accessed 02 December 14].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Foeniculum vulgare datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/24271.[Accessed 02 December 14].Paid subscription required .Robinson, C.

The fenugreek plant may have a single stem or may be branched at the stem base. The plant has an erect growth habit and a strong, sweet aroma.The leaves of the plant are small and trifoliate with oval leaflets which are green to purple in color.The plant produces solitary pale white or purplish flowers and a straight or occasionally curved yellow pod which houses the seeds.Between 10 and 20 seeds are produced per pod and they are small, smooth and brown, each divided into two lobes.Fenugreek can reach a height of 60 cm (23.6 in) and as an annual, survives only one growing season.The origin of fenugreek is unknown but it is indigenous to the western Mediterranean.Fenugreek foliage Fenugreek foliage Fenugreek Uses Fenugreek leaves can be used fresh or dried as a culinary herb.The seeds are used as a spice or flavoring.Propagation Fenugreek Content Basic requirements Fenugreek is a sun-loving plant which is usually grown as a cool season crop.
It grows optimally in well draining loams or sandy loams with a pH between 5.8 and 8.2. it will not grow well in heavy clay.Fenugreek is moderately drought resistant and can be grown in areas with low amounts of rainfall.In areas where the summer temperatures are high it is grown as a cool season crop but can be grown over summer in more temperate climates.The plants can withstand light frost.Propagation Fenugreek is propagated from seed and it does not withstand transplanting.It should be direct seeded to a depth of 1â€“2 cm (0.4â€“0.8 in) allowing 7.5 cm (3 in) between individual plants and 20â€“45 cm (8â€“18 in) between rows.It may also be be spread by broadcasting.General care and maintenance The most important aspect of fenugreek cultivation is keeping the bed free from weeds.Beds should be weeded regularly to prevent competition with the developing plants.The plants will benefit from additional irrigation if rainfall is not adequate.
In addition, productivity of fenugreek grown for seed will be increased with the addition of potash and phosphate fertilizer. Harvesting Fenugreek grown for seed is ready to harvest within 3 to 5 months after planting.The plants are harvested by uprooting and are then hung up to dry to allow seeds to be collected.In India, where the plant is grown as a vegetable crop, young shoots and leaves are harvested earlier and the plant is allowed to regrow before harvesting again.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Trigonella foenum-graecum datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/54923.[Accessed 03 December 14].Paid subscription required .Simon, J.E., Chadwick, A.F.& Craker, L.E.(1984).Herbs: An Indexed Bibliography.1971-1980.The Scientific Literature on Selected Herbs, and Aromatic and Medicinal Plants of the Temperate Zone.Archon Books, 770 pp., Hamden, CT.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/med-aro/factsheets/fenugreek.html.

The fig tree has numerous spreading branches and palmate leaves. The leaves are deeply lobed and thick with a rough upper surface and hairy lower surface.They have irregular teeth on the margins.The fig fruit is not technically a fruit, but a syconium , a flesh, hollow receptacle with tiny flowers on the inside walls.The fig is roughly oval or pear-shaped and can be yellow- green, bronze or dark purple in color.Fig trees can range in height from 3 to 9 m (10â€“30 ft) and can live for 50â€“75 years depending on conditions.Fig trees are believed to originate from Western Asia.Fig leaves Foliage and fruit Fig fruit Fig fruit Fig leaf buds and young fruit developing Fig fruit ripening on the tree Uses Fig fruits are consumed fresh or dried or may be processed to produce jams or fig paste.Fig Content Propagation Basic requirements Fig trees grow in both mild temperate climates and in the tropics, where it grows as an evergreen.
The tree is not generally very cold hardy and new growth in Spring can be damaged by temperatures of -1Â°C (30.2Â°F). Fig trees can be successfully grown on many types of soil but will grow optimally in deep sandy-clay loams with a pH between 6 and 8.Very light soils are not conducive to fig production and should be amended prior to planting through the addition of organic matter.Fig trees should be planted in full sun.In the home landscape, planting the to the South or East of a building can help protect them during cold spells in winter.Propagation Fig trees are generally vegetatively propagated from cuttings which are rooted in a nursery.Cuttings should be taken from the previous years growth in winter when the tree is dormant and should be 25 to 30 cm (10-12 in) in length.The cuttings should be severed at the nodes and planted in prepared nursery beds or pots to the tips to allow a strong root system to develop before transplanting.
The rooted cuttings should be ready for transplant the following winter. Transplanting Fig trees are traditionally planted as dormant rooted cuttings in winter or early spring.A hole should be dug that is deeper and wider than the existing root system as the cuttings perform well if planted a few inches deeper than in the nursery.Position the tree at the correct depth and carefully crumble the soil around the roots, tamping gently several times as the hole is filled.The newly planted tree should be watered to help settle the soil around the roots.It is not necessary to fertilize fig at time of planting.Once planted, the tree should be cut back by about 1/3 to counteract the effect of root loss during transplanting.If planting more than one tree, they should be positioned at least 6 m (20 ft) apart.
General care and maintenance Figs are typically grown as rain-fed trees in Mediterranean climates but the trees grow best when they have access to constant moisture as water stress can cause early leaf drop. Soil moisture can be conserved by mulching around the trees.Organic mulches also have the benefit of providing the tree with nutrients.Fig trees do benefit from the addition of fertilizer and the type and amount varies with the variety being grown.Pruning In sub-tropical areas, figs are commonly grown as a single trunk tree, however, in more temperate climates, it is common for fig to exist as a multi- trunked vase-shaped trees.This is encouraged through pruning to three or four primary branches from the trunk and two to three secondary branches stemming from the primary branches.
For the first few years, fig trees are pruned severely but after the shape has been formed pruning is limited to the removal of branches which are growing upright, touching the ground or those interfering with the growth of other branches.

The leaves of the plant are dark green, linear and mainly smooth with some hair along the leaf edges. The inflorescence of the plant is a cluster of 3â€“26 â€˜fingersâ€™ composed of dense spikelets where the grain, or seed, is produced.Finger millet can reach 1.7 m (5.6 ft) in height and is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season.Finger millet may also be referred to as African fingermillet, goosegrass or millet and originates from the highlands of Eastern Africa.Finger millet plants Finger millet Finger millet Uses Finger millet grains are commonly cooked and made into a porridge to accompany other foods.Grain may also be used in the brewing of alcoholic beverages.Millet straw can be used as an animal feed.Propagation Finger Millet Content Basic requirements Finger millet requires warm temperatures to develop optimally and as such is mainly grown in the tropics.
The optimum temperature for the growth of the plants is between 18Â°C (64.4Â°C F) and 27Â°C (80.6Â°F) and the plants require an average of 750 mm of rainfall over the course of the growing season. Finger millet can be grown in a wide range of soils but a fertile, well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.5 and 5.8 is optimal.Finger millet will not tolerate drought and will not grow well in areas with heavy rainfall.Planting If being grown as a rain-fed crop, finger millet is directly seeded in the field by broadcasting.Seeds should be sown to a depth of 2.5 cm (1.0 in) allowing 25 cm (10 in) between rows and 10â€“12 cm (4â€“5 in) between plants.The soil is commonly ridged to promote drainage in wet soils.When adequate irrigation is not available, the seeds are grown in nurseries to create transplant which are transferred to the field later.Finger millet is commonly intercropped with sorghum, maize or legumes such as pigeon pea or cowpea.
General care and maintenance The seedbed should be kept free from weeds as the plants develop to prevent competition for light and nutrients. The plants should be provided with additional irrigation during dry periods.Finger millet benefits from the addition of chemical fertilizers.In Africa, farmers fertilize using ash, while in India it is common for farmers to spread cow or sheep manure on the crop.Harvesting Finger millet is usually ready to harvest between 3.5 and 5 months after sowing depending on the variety.The crop is usually harvested by hand by cutting the seed heads or by cutting the entire plant.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Eleusine coracana datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/20674.[Accessed 03 December 14].Paid subscription required .

Fonio is an erect, tillering grass with delicate stems and alternate leaves. The leaves are blade like or linear and tapering and can reach up to 15 cm (6 in) in length.The plant produces spikelets, where the grain is produced, on branched, spike-like panicles.A single inflorescence possesses 2â€“5 racemes with spikelets arranged in pairs or in threes or fours, giving it a lacy appearance.White fonio can reach a height of 30â€“80 cm (11.8â€“31.5 in) depending on variety and is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season.White fonio may also be referred to fonio, hungry rice or hungry millet and originates from West Africa.Harvested fonio Uses The fonio grain is consumed after cooking, either as a porridge or couscous.The grain may also be ground and mixed with other cereals.Fonio grain may be used to brew beers and the straw can be used as animal fodder.Fonio Content Propagation Basic requirements Fonio is a tropical plant and requires a dry season to grow properly.
The plant grows optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30Â°C (77â€“86Â°F) and in areas where the average rainfall is between 900 and 1000 mm. Fonio can be grown on a range of soils and it is generally grown in soils that are considered too nutrient poor for other crops.The plants will grow best in light, sandy soils and it is often planted in rotation with rice, sorghum or millet.Planting Fonio is direct seeded by broadcasting in the field and germinates and grows rapidly, out-competing weeds and negating the need for weeding the field.The soil is roughly loosened prior to planting and seed is generally broadcast at a rate of 10 to 30 kg of seed/ha.The seeds are then lightly dug into the soil or covered using a hoe and allowed to germinate.General care and maintenance Fonio requires little maintenance after planting and is highly adapted to drought conditions.
Harvesting Fonio is harvested using traditional methods, The plants are cut using a knife or sickle and gathered into sheaths for drying. Processing the grain is a laborious process that requires beating the dried plants to extract the grain and then dehulling the grain using a mortar.Harvesting fonio Harvesting fonio Harvested fonio References Board on Science and Technology for International Development (1996) Lost Crops of Africa.Volume 1.Available at: http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2305&page=59.[Accessed 05 December 14].Free to access CIRAD (2009).Fonio.Available at: http://fonio.cirad.fr/en/the_plant.[Accessed 05 December 14].

It is a perennial flowering plant that grows from a bulb that contains outer layers of thin, whitish sheaths or skin that enclose various lobes known as cloves. One garlic bulb may contain 10 to 20 edible cloves that are asymmetrical in shape, except for the small ones, which are close to the center.Cloves, which are also covered by protective whitish skin, have a distinctive smell.Garlic, either in fresh or powdered form, is mainly used as a seasoning or condiment for flavoring food.It also has nutritional value, as raw garlic contains protein, starch, small amounts of fat and sugar, and high levels of potassium and vitamin C.Furthermore, garlic is widely valued for its medicinal importance as it contains bioactive constituents that are believed to help the body fight viral, fungal, and bacterial infections, among other health benefits such as lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels, among others.
In addition, garlic extracts have pesticide properties that play a vital role in protecting plants from some pests and diseases like African armyworm, downy mildew, and rice bugs, among others. While it is beneficial in organic farming, its use as a pesticide should be moderated as it can kill beneficial soil bacteria and insects due to its broad-spectrum effects.Origin.Garlic is believed to have originated in Central Asia (China).It then spread to the Mediterranean region in ancient times and was already known in Egypt by 3000 BC.Today, garlic is cultivated across the globe at latitudes ranging from 5 to 50 in both the northern and southern hemispheres.
Nutritive value The table below is a summary of the nutrition value per 100g of an edible portion of garlic Uses Garlic is primarily used for flavoring food and can be dried, ground or powdered for this purpose Garlic Varieties It is difficult to identify the wild primogenitor of common garlic due to the presence of numerous cultivars (clones). This makes it difficult to classify the clones.Despite this, there are two well-known garlic varieties, namely, cv.group Ophioscorodon, also known as hard-necked garlic, and cv.group Common Garlic, commonly referred to as soft-necked garlic (CABI, 2019).While the cv.group Common Garlic has a straight stalk, the cv.group Ophioscorodon, on the other hand, has a curvy scape.In addition, hard-necked garlic is best suited for the northern climate, while soft-necked garlic flourishes in southern climates.The two varieties do well in Kenya, although the soft-necked is more commonly planted.Climatic condition soil and water.
Temperature, and length of day are important factors in bulbing and bolting. Garlic is grown in a temperature-limited range of 9â€“28 Â°C.It is required that the propagules be exposed to 10â€“15 Â°C for 2 months to allow proper bulbing.Moreover, lower temperatures ranging from -2 to 6 Â°C are necessary for vernalization.Day length (>12 hours), on the other hand, stimulates clove formation.Garlic growth is easily adapted to all latitudes due to its wide genetic variation in response to temperature and day length.For instance, it is grown in the highlands around the equator to increase its growth.Also, garlic growth is recommended during the prevailing long-day season and at high altitudes in the tropics.In areas that experience long seasons of sub-freezing temperatures, mulching is advised to protect the plants from the cold.Mulching also conserves moisture and control weed growth.Garlic requires fertile, well-drained, non-crusting mineral soil, in organic matter to increase yields.
It should also be planted in raised beds to allow good soil drainage, which is essential. Garlic plants perform well in areas with low rainfall since excess rain and humidity are bad for their growth.Regular irrigation during dry seasons is advised, where moisture in the top 30 cm of the soil should be maintained during the entire growth period to attain maximum yields.However, in some areas, stopping irrigation three weeks before harvest is recommended to prevent rotting and skin color loss.Garlic curing Harvested garlic Garlic sprout emerging Planting procedures i) Cultivation and planting Prepare the soil a few weeks before planting for aeration; remove rocks and loosen the soil.While garlic can grow in soil with high organic matter, it can also grow in a variety of soil conditions and pH levels.A basal dressing of 200 kg/ha of triple superphosphate is recommended during soil tillage.Garlic is usually grown as an annual crop.It is normally cultivated using cloves as seeds.
To have quality and maximum yields, a farmer needs to plant healthy cloves. During seed selection, it is recommended that cloves planted should be of about equal weight (depending on cultivar) for uniformity purposes.The quantity of planting material is dependent on the size of the clove and the density of the plants.During planting, place selected cloves 8â€“10 cm apart within the rows and 15-20 cm between rows to leave enough space for bulbs to grow and mature well.The cloves should be planted with the pointed side up and the base down.Garlic plants are best grown as sole crops on raised beds alternated with furrows.Protect the garlic cloves through mulching.ii) Field operations Planting, watering, weeding, and harvesting are all done by hand.Avoid under-watering or over-watering the plants to allow optimal bulb formation.In cases where there is no rain, light watering (one inch deep) is enough.Dripline irrigation is recommended during the dry season.
Remove weeds that might hinder the crops from accessing maximum light, water, and nutrients. This can be done by mulching, hand hoeing, or spraying herbicides.80 kg/ha of ammonium sulphate is mixed with 50 kg/ha of potassium chloride and 80 kg/ha of urea and then applied as side dressings at 15, 30, and 45 days after planting.iii) Harvesting and storage Garlic grows about 60 cm (2 feet) tall.The duration of subsequent growth and development phases strongly depends on the prevailing conditions.The total growing period varies depending on the area, where harvesting takes place 3â€“4 months after planting (in the tropics) to about 9 months (for winter garlic in temperate regions).Harvesting is done once the leaves start turning yellow and begin to dry up.Once ready, the farmer pulls the bulbs out of the soil using their hands.They are then tied in bunches for drying and later stored in a dry place with good ventilation to inhibit growth or decay.References Cabi Digital Library.(2019).

The rhizome is brown, with a corky outer layer and pale- yellow scented center. The above ground shoot is erect and reed-like with linear leaves that are arranged alternately on the stem.The shoots originate from a multiple bases and wrap around one another.The leaves can reach 7 cm (2.75 in) in length and 1.9 cm (0.7 in) broad.Flowering heads are borne on shorter stems and the plant produces cone shaped, pale yellow flowers .The ginger plant can reach 0.6â€“1.2 m in height (2â€“4 ft) and is grown as an annual plant.Ginger may also be referred to as true ginger, stem ginger, garden ginger or root ginger and it is believed to have originated in the Southeast Asia.Ginger plant Ginger rhizomes with buds Ginger plant with flower Ginger foliage Ginger foliage Ginger plant Uses Ginger is popularly used as a spice in cooking and can be used either fresh, dried or powdered.The fresh rhizome can be Ginger Content used to extract ginger essential oil.
Ginger may also be used to flavor beverages. Ginger continues to be a popular folk remedy in China and India.Propagation Basic requirements As a tropical plant, ginger grows best in warm and sunny climates in a deep but well draining soil loam that is high in organic matter.The optimum soil pH for growth of ginger is between 6.0 and 6.5 and the plant requires a minimum temperature of 15.5Â°C (59.9Â°F).Ginger plants require an average annual rainfall of between 250 and 300 cm for optimal growth and development and require additional irrigation where rainfall is not adequate.Ginger plants will not tolerate waterlogged soils.Propagation Ginger is vegetatively propagated from small sections of the rhizome, called sets.Sets are produced by cutting a small 3â€“6 cm from a living rhizome.Each piece should possess at least one living bud which will produce shoots.
The ginger sets can be pre-sprouted in pots or nursery seed beds by covering with a layer of soil or they can be planted directly at the final planting location. The bed should be prepared for planting by digging to soil to a fine tilth and removing any weeds that are present.The addition of lime to the soil adjusts the pH while helping to provide the calcium required by the plants during their growth.Lime should be added to the soil in appropriate amounts in the Fall prior to planting.The sets should then be planted in early Spring at a depth of 5â€“12 cm, leaving 15â€“35 cm between plants and 25â€“30 cm between rows.For optimal growth, the soil temperature at planting should not fall below 25Â°C (77Â°F).General care and maintenance Ginger has a tendency to grow horizontally and the soil can be hilled around the growing stems to force a more vertical growth habit.Soil should be hilled 3 to 5 times during the growing season.
Any exposed rhizomes should be covered with soil and weeds should be removed from the bed. Ginger will benefit from the addition of a complete fertilizer as well as phosphorous, calcium and organic matter prior to planting.During the growing season, additional fertilizer can be applied as a side dressing.The side dressing should be made 25 to 30 cm (10-12 in) from the row of plants due to ginger being easily damaged by fertilizer applications.Side dressings should be made every 2 to 3 weeks during the growing season to ensure the ginger is suppied with adequate nutrients.Harvesting Ginger is usually harvested after the leaves senesce, dry out and the stem falls over.Ginger roots are harvested by digging.Commercially produced ginger is harvested with the use of cutter bar which is pulled by a tractor.After harvest, the ginger should be cured for 3 to 5 days to prevent the development of mildew on the rhizomes.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.

The gooseberry bush is a spiny shrub with deeply lobed, dark green leaves and produce bell shaped flowers and green/yellow to red berries approximately 1 inch long containg many tiny seeds.If managed properly, gooseberry bushes can be very long lived, growing to 0.9â€“3.0 m (3â€“10 ft) tall and up to 1.8 m (6 ft) wide and producing a crop of fruit each spring.The gooseberry has been derived mainly from two species, the European gooseberry Ribes grossularia , native to North Africa, and the American gooseberry ( Ribes hirtellum ), native to Northeast and central US and parts of Canada.
The American gooseberry tends to be smaller than the species grown in Europe, with weeping stems that will rot easily if they are allowed to be in contact with the ground. Developing fruits Gooseberry fruits Gooseberry flowers Gooseberry flowers Gooseberry bush Gooseberry fruit Uses Gooseberries can be eaten fresh or used as an ingredient in other foods such as desserts, jams and preserves or drinks Gooseberry Content such as tea.The fruit can also be used as an ingredient for pickling.They are also used to flavor beverages such as sodas, flavored waters, or milk, and can be made into fruit wines and teas.They can be preserved in the forms of jams or dried fruit.Propagation Basic requirements Gooseberries grow best in cool, moist locations and can be damaged by intense summer heat.Gooseberry can be grown in partial shade but it is essential that the plants have a good air circulation around them to help prevent the development of disease.
Gooseberry has a chilling requirement of between 1000 to 1200 hours between 1.7 and 7.2Â°C (35â€“45Â°F) to break dormancy. Plants can tolerate cold and light frosts but temperatures below -2Â°C (28Â°F) can cause damage to the flower buds.Gooseberries can be grown successfully in a range of soils but perform optimally in well-draining sandy loams which are rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5.Propagation Gooseberry plants can be planted as rooted plants obtained from a nursery or from cuttings from established plants.Cuttings should be taken in winter or early spring when the plant is dormant.Cuttings should be 15â€“20 cm (6â€“8 in) in length and taken from the previous years growth.The cuttings should be stored in sand or peat moss in a refrigerator or other cold location until early spring.Planting Gooseberry plants and cuttings should be planted out in early spring.Plants obtained from a nursery should have a strong root system.
Remove any damaged roots prior to planting and cut the stems back so that they are between 15 and 25 cm (6â€“10 in) depending on the size of the root system. Plant the gooseberries in prepared soil a little deeper than they were in the nursery and gently tamp the soil around the plants.Spacing depends on the variety being grown but generally gooseberries should be spaced 0.9â€“1.5 m (3â€“5 ft) apart, allowing 2.4â€“3.0 m (8â€“10 ft) between rows.Closer spacings can be used if a hedgerow is desired.Cuttings should be similarly spaced.The tips of the cuttings can be dipped in rooting hormone prior to planting to encourage root development.Pruning Gooseberries should be pruned in the winter while dormant.Damaged or drooping canes should be removed as well as any which shade the center of the plant.After the first year of growth, the plant should be cut to leave 6 to 8 vigorous canes.
After the second growing season all but 4 or 5 one year old shoots and 3 or 4 two year old canes should be removed. after the third growing season, retain 3â€“4 each of 1-, 2- and 3- year old wood.After the fourth growing season, all of the four year old wood should be removed and the plants should be pruned annually following the directions for after the third growing season.References Bratsch, A.Speciality Crop Profile: Ribes (Currants and Gooseberries).Virginia Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/438/438-107/438-107_pdf.pdf.[Accessed 11 December 14].Free to access Roper, T.R., Mahr, D.L.& McManus, P.L.(1998).Growing currants, gooseberries and elderberries in Wisconsin.University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A1960.PDF.[Accessed 11 December 14].

The two most commonly grown types of gourd are Lagenaria species and Cucurbita species. Gourd plants produce long vines with long-stemmed, large, oval or triangular lobed leaves.The Cucurbita gourds produce yellow flowers and unusually shaped fruit which can be smooth or warty, plain or patterned.The Lagenaria gourds produce white flowers and smooth, knobly or ridged fruit which can range in size from 7 cm (3 in) up to 1 m (3 ft).Gourd vines are capable of climbing over 3.5 m (12 ft) and as annual plants, survive only one growing season.Gourds may also be referred to as dudi, cucuzzi, spaghetti squash or calabash and are believed to have originated in Africa.gourd flower Bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) plant growing on a frame A colorful selection of gourds Uses Young gourds can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable while the mature gourds are used to make decorative items such as bottles, containers and utensils.
In the US, gourds have become a very popular household decoration in the Fall. Gourd Content Propagation Basic requirements Gourds are warm-season crops, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally.Plants will grow best at temperatures between 18 and 25Â°C (65â€“75Â°F) in a fertile, well-draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.Gourd plants should be planted in full sun and provided with ample soil moisture.Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space.Sowing seeds Gourds can be direct seeded or sown indoors and transplanted.If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 15.6Â°C (60Â°F).Sow 1â€“2 seeds 1.3â€“2.5 cm (0.5â€“1.0 in) deep, at least 90 cm (~3 ft) apart if growing bush varieties and 120â€“150 cm (4â€“5 ft) apart if growing vining varieties.Allow a further 1â€“3 m (6â€“10 ft) between rows depending on the variety.
If transplanting, seeds should be sown 3â€“4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted before the plants develop their second set of true leaves. Sowing seeds in 3â€“4 inch pots help to minimize disturbance to the roots prior to transplanting.Peat pots can be transplanted with the seedlings eliminating the need to disturb the roots entirely.Seeds in sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering.Seeds should germinate in 5â€“10 days depending on the soil temperature.General care and maintenance Gourd plants sprawling and require plenty space to grow.Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence.Plants also require a continuous supply of water and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water.Shallow watering or watering less frequently encourages a shallow root system.
Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene mulch has the advantage of warming the soil. Gourds produce both male and female flowers (monoecious) and are pollinated by insects such as bees.Poor fruit set is often caused by poor pollination.References Dana, M.N.& Lerner, B.R.(2000).Gourds.Purdue University Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/HO-135.pdf.[Accessed 12 December 14].Free to access .Jones, T.(2009).Gourds.University of Kentucky College of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uky.edu/Ag/NewCrops/introsheets/gourds.pdf.[Accessed 12 December 14].Free to access .Zitter, T.A., Hopkins, D.L.& Thomas, C.E.(1996).Compendium of Cucurbit diseases.American Phytopathological Society Press.Available at: http://www.apsnet.org/apsstore/shopapspress/Pages/42074.aspx.Available for purchase from APS Press .

The vines can reach lengths in excess of 30 m and can live for many years with proper management. The leaves of the grape vine are alternately arranged on the stem and are long and broad with 5â€“7 lobes, typically reaching sizes of 5â€“20 cm (2.0â€“7.9 in).Flowers are produced in clusters and fruit.The fruit is a berry known as a grape and grows in clusters from the vine.In wild species, the fruit is 6 mm (1/5 in) in diameter and ripens to dark purple to black with a pale wax bloom.In cultivated plants, the berry is usually much larger, up to 3 cm (1.2 in) long and can be green, red or purple.Vitis vinifera is native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia but is cultivated on every continent except Antarctica.Most grape cultivation centers on the use of Vitis vinifera , however, in North America the related species Vitis labrusca , Vitis riparia and Vitis rotundifolia are also grown.
Vitis amurensis is native to Asia and has been hybridized with Vitis vinifera to produce cold tolerant grapevine varieties. Vineyard in Italy Young grapes Grape vine and trellis Grape buds Nebbiolo grapes Cultivated purple grape Grape Content Uses Grapes are the most widely produced commercial fruit crop in the world.They are often eaten fresh but are also commonly used to produce wine.Grapes can also be processed into jams, and preserves, juices, grape seed oil, grape seed extract, raisins and vinegar.Propagation Requirements The first consideration when attempting to cultivate grape is to select a variety based on the prevailing local climate, with the best production occurring in hot, dry regions.American varieties tend to be the most cold hardy while the European hybrids perform best in hotter, drier regions.Generally, vines should be grown in full sun, in a well draining soil and in a location where there is good circulating air to reduce incidence of disease.
Low lying areas should be avoided when selecting a planting site as this can lead to water accumulation during periods of wet weathe Vines prefer a soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH between 6.0 and 7.0 and require a trellis system to support the weight of the fruit on the vines. Preparation Grape vines are usually planted as dormant bare root vines in Spring.Young plants can be purchased from nurseries and garden centres for planting in the home garden.Grape vines require a trellis and this should be built before the vines are planted in the ground.For information on constructing a suitable trellis see: https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/192-grape-how-to-build-a-trellis-for-grape-vines?locale=en.The trellis helps support the weight of the fruit and protects the vines from damage while aslo increasing air circulation and reducing diseases in the canopy.You may also consider a more decorative method of supporting the vines, such as an arbor.
Planting New vines should be planted out in Spring after all danger of frost has passed. Dig a hole for each plant approximately 30 cm (12 in) deep and 30 cm (12 in) wide, spaced 1.8â€“ 3.0 m (6â€“10 ft) apart and plant the vine at the same level as the nursery.It is important not to cover the graft union in soil.Tamp the soil around the plants and add any remaining soil.The newly planted vines should be cut back to have only 2 or 3 new buds and watered lightly.Training In order for grape vines to develop strong root systems and support heavy loads of fruit, new vines should not be allowed to produce fruit for the first 2â€“3 years after planting.The vine will produce new shoots, of which several should be allowed to grow while the others are cut back.This allows the vine to fill out with leaves which provide energy for an extensive root system.The new shoots should be attached to the trellis.
At the beginning of the second year of growth, select 2â€“3 of the strongest canes on each plant and cut back the rest. Allow 3 or 4 shoots to develop on each cane and attach to the trellis.Remove any flower clusters that form.Pruning Pruning is an essential component of healthy grape production and should be carried out annually in early Spring while the vines are still dormant and before the buds begin to swell.From the third year onwards, most of the previous years growth should be removed.The more buds that are left on each shoot, the more fruit it will produce but care must be taken to ensure that too many are not left as the fruit may not ripen as a result.Fruit clusters can be removed as required throughout the growing season.Grape trellis schematic for French grapes Grapes can be grown on arbors or porches Grape trellis schematics References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Vitis vinifera datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/56504.

Grapefruit is less hardy than orange but continual exposure to cooler temperatures will induce a certain degree of cold tolerance.Mature trees can tolerate short exposures to temperatures below freezing but ice will begin to form in fruit after 2-3 hours at -3Â°C (27Â°F).Young trees may be killed by these temperatures.young trees will be killed.Fruit will also be damaged by freezing conditions.The trees will tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil.Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development.Grapefruit trees will grow best when planted in full sun.
Grapefruit propagation Grapefruit seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock as seeds will not produce fruit true to type. Grafting is the process by which a scion from plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree.Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud.Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well.Common rootstocks for grafting and budding of citrus trees include sour orange and rough lemon.Budding Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6â€“9 mm/0.25â€“0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant).
Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined.It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees.The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees.The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves.These budsticks can be stored for 2â€“3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding.The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground.
Using a sharp knife, a 2.5â€“3.8 cm (1â€“1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a â€œT-shapeâ€​ The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark.Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud.This piece should measure 1.9â€“2.5 cm(0.75â€“1.0 in) in length.Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant.Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.After the union has formed and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem 2.5â€“3.9 cm (1.0â€“1.5 in) above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem on the same side as the join.
The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as â€œloppingâ€​ allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in lengthe, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.Planting seedlings Grapefruit trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard.The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area.Trees should be planted at or higher than the level of the nursery pot.Once the tree is positioned in the planting hole, backfill the soil by about half and water to allow the soil to settle around the lower roots before filling in the hole.The newly planted tree should be watered every few days.General care Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established.
During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3â€“7 days.The soil should be moist, but not wet.Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently.Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year.Grapefruit trees will need protected from cold temperatures to prevent damage.Soil can be mounded up around the trunk during the winter and removed in the Spring.Young trees can also be protected from frosts by covering them with tarps or blankets as required.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Citrus x paradisi datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13461.[Accessed 12 December 14].Paid subscription required .Timmer, L.W., Garnsey, S.M.& Graham, J.H.(2000).Compendium of Citrus Diseases.American Phytopathological Society Press.

A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of â€œhuang long bingâ€​, which translates to â€œyellow dragon diseaseâ€​, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees.By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively.
The disease has been known by various names in different countries - â€œgreeningâ€​ in South Africa, â€œmottle leafâ€​ in the Philippines, â€œdiebackâ€​ in India and â€œvein phloem degenerationâ€​ in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant.The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter.It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L.
africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L.asiaticus , found in .A third species, L.americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements.As this species is found in the same areas as L.asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements.Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting.The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar.Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew.
Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed.They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers.When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days.In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur.It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments.
Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956.The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured.Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest.Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus.
Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified.In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms.(ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays.Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T.eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk.In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease.Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.

Guava has a slender trunk with smooth green to red-brown bark. The trunk may be branched at the base and the branches droop low to the ground.The plant possesses oval or elliptical leaves which are smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the lower surface.Guava produces solitary white flowers and a berry fruit.The fruit is oval in shape and green to yellow in color.The flesh inside can be white, yellow, pink or red in color and contains numerous yellowish seeds.Guava can reach grow to 10 m (33 ft) in height and lives for approximately 40 years.Guava may also be referred to as common guava and its origin is unknown although it grows native in parts of tropical America.Fruits Flesh of guava fruit Fruits Developing guava fruits Bee visiting guava flower Guava flower Guava leaves Guava plant Guava fruits growing on the tree Guava Content Uses Guava fruits may be eaten fresh or processed to produce paste, jellies or preserves.Dehydrated fruit is used to make guava powder.
Propagation Basic requirements Guava is mainly grown in the tropics and will tolerate temperatures between 15 and 45Â°C (59â€“113Â°F). Guava will grow optimally between 23 and 28Â°C (73â€“82Â°F) but established trees can tolerate short periods at -3 to -2Â°C (27-28Â°F) although temperatures below 15Â°C (60Â°F) can cause the tree to cease producing fruit.Guava is also amenable to a wide range of soils and will grow in both sandy or rocky soils in addition to loams, preferring a pH of 4.5â€“7 but tolerating alkaline soil to to pH 8.5.Guava is more resistant to drought than most tropical fruits and can withstand long periods of dry weather by ceasing vegetative growth until conditions improve.Propagation Guavas grown for processing can be grown from seed as approximately 70% of the seedlings will retain the genetic characteristics of the parent tree.Guavas that are grown for fresh fruit are usually vegetatively propagated by air layering or budding.
Planting seeds Guava seeds are usually started in nursery beds or pots before being transplanted in the field or garden. Only seeds from healthy, vigorous trees with the desired characteristics should be planted.Seeds should be planted in flats containing sandy soil and covered to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in).Seeds usually germinate within 15 to 20 days of planting.When the seedlings reach 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in height they should be transplanted into individual pots.Seedling are ready to be moved to the field after about 6 to 7 months when they have reached approximately 30.5 cm (12 in) in height.Transplanting seedlings Guava trees should be planted in full sun and should be spaced 4.5â€“7.5 m (15â€“25 ft) away from other trees and buildings to prevent shading.A hole should be dug which is slightly larger than the existing root ball and the addition of a layer of compost or rotted manure at the bottom of the planting hole.
The tree should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery by placing the seedling upright into the planting hole and backfilling the soil around the plant. The soil should be tamped by hand around the tree to eliminate any air pockets.Water the newly planted seedlings immediately unless the soil is already damp.General care and maintenance Newly planted guava trees should be watered every two days after planting for the first week and then once a week for the following few months to allow the root system to develop and become established.A 0.6 to 1.5 m (2.0-5.0 ft) area around the trunk should be maintained to be free from grass and weeds.Guava trees benefit from the application of a layer or organic mulch such as bark or wood chips around the base.This helps to suppress weeds and conserve moisture in the soil.Do not mound the mulch around the trunk, allow a gap of 20 to 30 cm (8-10 in) between the trunk and the mulch layer.
Young trees benefit from fertilizer application with the type an amount varying with area and soil type. Pruning Young trees should be pruned to encourage the development of laterals.This is achieved by cutting back existing laterals at 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 ft).During the first year of growth, 3 to 4 of the lateral branches should be allowed to grow 60 to 90 cm (24-36 in) before the tips are cut to encourage further branching.any new shoots formed by this process should also be tipped when they reach 60 to 90 cm (24-36 in).Pruning of established trees should be carried out to retain a manageable height and to open out the canopy.Harvesting Trees grown from seed may not come into production for anywhere between 3 to 8 years.Guava does not ripen off the tree and it can be difficult to distinguish when the fruits are ready for harvest.The best indication is a color change from dark to light green and the development of some yellowing on the fruits.
Fruit should be harvested every 2-3 days to prevent fruit becoming overripe.

Hazelnuts are large multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees with rounded leaves which possess a doubly serrated margin (each tooth bears another tooth). They produces flowers very late in the winter prior to the emergence of any leaves.The female flowers are small and only the bright red stigmas are visible protruding from the bud.The male flower is a catkin which is pale yellow in color and measures 6â€“12 cn (2â€“5 in) in length.The fruit of the hazelnut is a classic nut which grows in clusters of 1â€“5, each protected by a leafy husk which covers most (common) or all of the nut (filbert).The nut is oval in shape and yellow to brown in colour.Each has a pale scale at its base.When ripe, the nut falls from the husk to the ground.Hazenut can reach a height of 3â€“8 m (10â€“26 ft) and can live for many years, although its commercial lifespan is usually about 40 years.Hazelnut originates from Europe and South East Asia.
Hazelnut catkins Hazelnut shrubs Young hazelnut trees Hazelnut Hazelnuts on the tree Hazelnuts Hazelnut (filbert) Content Uses The kernel of the hazelnut is edible and can be eaten raw or toasted. The kernels can be processed to produce praline or as an ingredient in confectionery and baked goods.Propagation Basic requirements Filberts are hardy plants which can survive adverse growing conditions.They should be grown in a soil which is at least 2.4 to 3 m (8-10 ft) deep and will grow optimally in well-draining, fertile loams with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5 in full sun or partial shade.Filberts will grow well in areas where wild hazel grows large and vigorous.Propagation methods While it is possible to propagate filberts from cuttings, the success rate for obtaining rooted cuttings is usually only between 20 and 50%.The most successful method of propagating filberts is by layering.The most successful and widely used method of layering for commercial filbert production is tip layering.
Tip layering involves bending shoots into a V-shape and burying the lower parts in the soil to a depth of 20 to 25 cm (8-10 in) while the tips of the shoot, which will form the new tree tops, are kept upright. The soil is kept moist to promote root development above the V bend on the tip and roots should ideally be congregated in a 5 to 10 cm (2-4 in) section of the shoot.Planting Trees should be planted in early winter while dormant.The trees should be planted at least 6 m (20 ft) apart.Before planting, remove as much as possible of the old layered shoot and prune back the ends of any broken roots.Plant the tree in a hole large enough to accommodate the roots but avoid deep planting.Fill in the hole around the roots with fine soil, pressing down with your hands to eliminate any air pockets around the roots.Add soil on top of the roots and tamp down to set the tree.Fill in the remainder of the hole with loosely packed soil.
Once planted, the tree should be headed back in order to compensate for reduced water uptake. the tree should be cut back to a height of 45 to 76 cm (18-30 in).Suckering Hazelnut trees produce suckers which should be removed from the tree at, or close to, their point of origin on the trunk.This can be achieved by gently removing the soil from around the sucker.While the trunk is exposed, any other buds which are beginning to show should also be removed.Cutting the sucker at or just below the soil line will encourage more suckers so it is important to make the cut as close to the trunk as possible.Harvesting Newly planted trees usually bear nuts within two to three years after planting although full production may not be reached until twenty five years after planting.The nuts are usually harvested two to three times over the season.The nuts can be spread out on the ground to dry or, as with commercially produced nuts, dried artificially at a temperature of 90 to 100Â°C (176-212Â°F).

The hop plant is a climbing plant with grasping hooks that help it grasp the substrate. The plant climbs upwards in a clockwise direction and has opposing pairs of leaves which are covered in hairs.The plant produces flowers called 'burrs' which develop into scaly cones, or 'hops'.The hop plant vine can grow 6â€“9 m (20â€“30 ft) in length and can be harvested for many years.Hop may also be referred to as common hop and likely originated from Central Asia but now grows native in many areas in the Northern Hemisphere.Hop plants Hop vine Hop plant Hop leaf Hop flowers Hop cones Uses Hop cones are usually dried and used in the brewing of beer to impart bitterness and aroma.Hop Content Propagation Basic requirements Hop plants can grow in a wide variety of soils as long as there is adequate drainage, but a loose loam or sandy loam with a high organic content and a pH between 6.0 and 7.5 will produce optimal growth.
Hop plants are perennial and can be harvested for many years, they should be provided with adequate vertical space to allow the vines to spread. Hop plants should be grown in full sun and require a tall trellis or fence which is large enough to support 6 to 9 m (20-30 ft) of vine growth.The plants require a period of approximately 8 weeks at low temperature in order to break dormancy.Propagation Hop plants are vegetatively propagated from the pieces of rhizome which should be obtained from a reputable breeder.Only female rhizomes should be planted as it is the female flower that is harvested.Plants grown from seed exhibit highly variable characteristics and are not suitable for commercial production.Planting Hops should be planted as soon as the soil can be worked in the Spring.The plants can survive a frost but will not tolerate the ground freezing over.Rhizomes should be kept refrigerated until the soil is ready for planting.
Rhizomes should be planted horizontally in trenches approximately 30 cm (12 in) deep, leaving 1.5â€“2.5 m (5â€“8.2 ft) between plants. Hop plant require a trellis system in order to train the long vines.The support system usually consists of a supporting pole and wire with strings for the plant to grow on.There may be up to four strings per plant which are fixed from the ground to the wire.General care and maintenance After the first year of growth, the plants will produce an excessive amount of shoots which need to be cut back once several shoots have been selected and trained to grow on the supporting structure.Unwanted shoots can also be defoliated using chemicals.Mounding earth around the base of the plants will help to reduce the amount of unwanted shoots.The soil around the hop vines should be amended with compost every spring and the vines will also benefit from a side dressing of nitrogen fertilizer later in the growing season.
Harvesting Hop cones should be harvested before the first frost. Generally, cones are harvested in mid-August to mid-September.The cones will have a papery texture when they are ready and will produce a fine yellow powder and strong aroma when crushed.The lower bracts of the cone may also be beginning to turn brown.The vines should be lowered to the ground and the cones removed from the plant.the cones should be dried prior to storage by threading them out thinly on a screen and allowing to air dry.The cones are fully dry when the inner stem becomes brittle.Commercial hop production References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Humulus lupulus datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/27956.[Accessed 18 November 14].Paid subscription required .Drost, D.(20100.Hops in the Garden.Utah State Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HG_Garden_2006-06.pdf.[Accessed 18 December 14].Free to access .

The leaves of the plant grow in a distinctive rosette pattern sprouting from single or multiple stems. The leaves have long petioles and can be smooth or crinkled, reaching 30â€“100 cm (12â€“40 in) in length.The taproot is thick and fleshy and cylindrical in shape and can reach 50 cm (20 in) in length.The plant produces many white flowers on racemes.Horseradish plants are usually grown as annuals, surviving only one growing season and can reach a height of 1.5 m (5 ft).Horseradish may also be referred to as red cole or pepper rod and originates from south-eastern Europe and western Asia.Flowering horseradish plant Horseradish plant Harvested horseradish root Horseradish leaves Horseradish flowers Horseradish flowers Uses Horseradish is grown as a vegetable and can be eaten fresh or cooked.Due to its bitter taste, it is commonly used to make sauces which accompany meat or fish.
Horseradish Content Propagation Basic requirements Horseradish grows best in temperate climates in full sun or partial shade at temperatures between 15.5 and 28Â°C (60â€“65Â°F) . If grown as an annual, the plant requires a long growing season with a warm summer and cooler temperatures in late summer and fall to allow the flavor to develop in the root.Horseradish can be grown in most soils as long as they are well draining but will grow optimally in a deep, fertile, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.Propagation Horseradish is usually vegetatively propagated by dividing crowns or from root cuttings.It can be grown from supermarket bought root as it is not treated with any chemicals that affect growth.The disadvantage is that the variety and characteristics may not be known.Root pieces are small, pencil size pieces of root which grow from the main root.
They are referred to a sets and as the horseradish root exhibits polarity, it is important to make a note of which end of the set is the top and which is the bottom in order to plant the piece the correct orientation. A good way of doing this is to use a straight cut across the top end of the set and an oblique cut at the bottom.If planting by dividing an established crown, the plant should be carefully dug from the soil and split into four equal pieces each with some leaf and root.Planting Horseradish sets should be planted as soon as the soil is workable in the spring.The soil should be prepared for planting by double digging and incorporating composted organic matter and all purpose fertilizer.The root sets can be planted in shallow trenches which are approximately 10 to 12 cm (4-5 in) allowing 45â€“60 cm (18â€“24 in) between individual plants and deep and at least 30 cm (1 ft) between rows.
The sets should be planted at a 45Â° angle so that the top of the set is higher in the soil than the bottom end. General care and maintenance Horseradish should be provided with approximately 1 to 2 inches of water each week.Additional irrigation may be required during dry spells.Care should be taken not to overwater the plants or allow them to become too dry as this will affect the flavor of the harvested root.An additional dose of fertilizer high in potassium and phosphorous but low in nitrogen should be applied 4 to 8 weeks after planting.Excess nitrogen should be avoided as it will encourage too much top growth on the plants and will also cause the roots to branch.Horseradish plants will benefit from the addition of a layer of organic mulch which will help to suppress weed growth.I f no mulch is added then any weeds around young horseradish should be removed by gently cultivation the soil around the plants.
Many growers make use of the practice of lifting and suckering their horseradish plants. Once the plant has begun to grow, it is gently lifted to expose the crown and any branching roots are removed.This focusses the plants energy on growing the main root.Harvesting Horseradish should be harvested when the tops have been frozen back in the fall.In commercial fields, the tops of the plants are mowed back to facilitate mechanical digging.In the home garden, the roots can be dug up with a fork and the tops removed after harvest.The roots should be scrubbed clean before storing.Leaving some small pieces of root in the ground will allow the plant to regrow the following year.If regrowth is not desired then all pieces of root should be dug up and removed to prevent the horseradish becoming a weed in the garden.References Bratsch, A.Speciality Crop File: Horseradish.Virginia Cooperative Extension.available at: https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/438/438-104/438-104_pdf.pdf.[Accessed 19 December 14].

The kale plant is a non-heading, cabbage like plant with curly or straight, loose blue- green or purple leaves. Kale is usually grown as as an annual plant, harvested after one growing season and can reach a height of 1 m (3.3 ft).Kale may also be referred to as borecole or non-heading cabbage or broccoli and its exact origins are unknown, although it grows native in regions of the eastern Mediterranean and Asia.Harvested curly kale Young kale leaves Kale foliage Close-up view of kale leaf Curly kale variety Kale Kale Content Kale Nutrition Kale is a nutritious food rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin K, and beta-carotene.It also contains nutrients that can support eye health, weight management and heart health.Loaded with important micronutrients and antioxidants, kale is one of the most nutritious leafy greens available.In fact, kale contains a variety of beneficial compounds, some of which have powerful medicinal properties.
itâ€™s versatile and boasts a nutty, earthy flavour that works well in a wide range of recipes. uses Kale is used as a green vegetable and is usually cooked before consumption.Some varieties of kale are grown as decorative ornamental plants due to their attractive, brightly colored foliage.Kale Variety "Thousand Headed" This is a continuous growing and hardy crop that is tolerant to cold temperatures.It can stay in the field for a long time, therefore, giving a higher yield.It has a thick stem with big leaves that are dark green, smooth and attractive.It matures between 90-100 days.It can also be used as fodder for animals.It is easily digestible and easy to cook."Southern Georgia" It is a very popular seed variety grown across Africa.It has been developed to give high yields while up to 6 months before flowering thus profitable to farmers.The leaves are well flavored and easy to cook.It is popular in the local market.It is adapted to hot areas.It is hardy and resistant to black rot.
"Marrow Stem" The variety has dark green leaves and flavor and little fiber. It is vigorous, medium tall with finely curled leaves which are less prone to bird damage.Kale growing in Kenya In Kenya, kale is mainly grown in the highlands, which are located in the central, western, and parts of the eastern regions of the country.These regions have a cool climate, and the soil is rich in nutrients, which is ideal for growing kale.Examples of these regions include the Mount Kenya region, the Aberdares, and the Elgeyo Marakwet .Propagation Climatic conditions and soil type Kale is cool season crop that grows best in cool, moist conditions.The plant will grow best at temperatures between 4 and 21Â°C (40â€“50Â°F) allowing it to be grown in both Spring and Fall.Kale is a hardy plant, tolerating frost, and will grow optimally in a rich, moist, well draining soil with a pH of 6.5.Kale requires at least six hours of direct sunlight every day.
Sowing seeds Kale can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants. The optimum soil temperature for germination is between 12 and 24Â°C (55â€“75Â°F).Kale seeds should be planted after any danger of hard frost or in a cold frame for transplanting to their final location.For a Fall harvest, try to time seeding so that the plants will mature in cool weather.This often means sowing in July but may be as late as October in warmer Southern regions.Prepare the soil for planting through the addition of nitrogen in the form of bone meal or composted manure.Plant seeds 12 mm (0.5 in) deep allowing 3.5 cm (1 in) between plants in the row.Thin seedlings to a final within row spacing of 45â€“60 cm (18â€“24 in).Keep soil moist during germination to prevent a crust from forming on the soil surface as this will cause uneven germination.
Transplanting Seedlings started indoors or in a cold frame are ready to be transplanted when they have 3â€“4 leaves and the daytime temperature has reached 10Â°C (50Â°F). Seedlings should be planted at the final spacing for seeds (45â€“60 cm/18â€“24 in between plants and 0.6 to 1.2 m/2â€“4 ft between rows).Plant each seedling slightly deeper than it was previously.The plantings can be staggered in 2 week intervals to prolong the harvest.General care Kale should be kept evenly watered, application of mulch around plants helps to conserve soil moisture.The plants have shallow roots and in order to avoid damaging them, it is preferable to hand pull any weeds growing around the plants.Kale plants are heavy feeders, requiring plentiful nitrogen to meet their growth requirements and develop optimally.Apply an appropriate complete fertilizer when thinning seedlings.Harvesting Kale leaves can be harvested when they are 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) long.
Harvest the outer leaves to avoid damaging the growing tip of the plant. Kale leaves are sweeter when they are harvested after frost.References Anderson, C.R.Home Gardening Series.Kale.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/fsa-6069.pdf.[Accessed 21 December 14].Free to access .Drost, D.& Johnson, M.(2005).Kale in the Garden.Utah State University Extension.Available at: http://extension.usu.edu/boxelder/files/uploads/Vegetable%20Gardens/KALE0505.pdf.[Accessed 21 December 14].Free to access .Rimmer, S.R., Shattuck, V.I.Buchwaldt, L.(Eds) (2007).Compendium of Brassica Diseases.American Phytopathological Society Press.Available at: http://www.apsnet.org/apsstore/shopapspress/Pages/42848.aspx.Available for purchase from APS Press .Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Alternaria leaf spot (Black spot, Gray spot) Alternaria brassicae Alternaria brassicicola Alternaria as a secondary invader of kale stem tissue.

Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage loopers egg Cabbage looper adult Cabbage looper Cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) cabbage looper feeding on leaves Cabbage looper and damage Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color. Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range.
Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully. Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Army cutworm (Euxoa auxiliaris) Cutworm feeding on plant stem Bronzed cutworm (Nephelodes minians) adult Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Greasy cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon aneituma) adult Cutworm larva severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed. Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato.
Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically.
Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella Diamondback moth early instar larva Diamondback moth adult Diamondback moth egg Larva feeding on cabbage leaf Diamondback moth feeding on Brassicae Diamondback moth pupae Symptoms Young larvae feed between upper and lower leaf surface and may be visible when they emerge from small holes on the underside of the leaf; older larvae leave large, irregularly shaped shotholes on leaf undersides, may leave the upper surface intact; larvae may drop from the plant on silk threads if the leaf is disturbed; larvae are small (1 cm/0.3 in) and tapered at both ends; larvae have to prolegs at the rear end that are arranged in a distinctive V-shape. Cause Insect Comments Larvae take between 10 and 14 days to mature and spin a loose, gauze-like cocoon on leaves or stems to pupate.
Management Larvae can be controlled organically by applications of Bacillus thurengiensis or Entrust; application of appropriate chemical insecticide is only necessary if larvae are damaging the growing tips of the plants. Flea beetles Phylotreta spp.Adult flea beetle on a leaf crucifer flea beetle (Phyllotreta cruciferae) on Chinese cabbage.Adults and associated damage on cabbage Crucifer flea beetle damage on broccoli leaf Shothole" damage on chinese cabbage due to crucifer flea beetle Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance.
Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied.

Symptoms Large ragged holes in leaves or bored into head; green-brown frass (insect feces) on leaves; caterpillar is green in color and hairy, with a velvet-like appearance; may have faint yellow to orange stripes down back; slow-moving compared with other caterpillars.Cause Insect Comments Larvae can be distinguished from other caterpillars by their sluggish movement; in large numbers larvae can cause extensive damage very quickly.
Management Hand-pick caterpillars from plants and destroy; scrape eggs from leaves prior to hatching; apply appropriate insecticide if infestation is very heavy. Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Second instar nymph (and damage to leaf) of the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci).Western flower thrips First instar nymph of onion thrips (Thrips tabaci).Onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color.Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life.
Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic.

The plant is vigorous and woody with nearly circular leaves which have long petioles and are alternately arranged on the stems. Young leaves and shoots are covered in tiny red hairs, while mature leaves are smooth and dark green on the upper surface and white and downy on lower surface.The kiwi plant produces fragrant white-yellow flowers singly or in clusters of 3 at the leaf axils (area between leaf and stem).The fruit is oval or ovoid in shape with green-brown skin covered in stiff brown hairs.The flesh of the fruit is bright green and juicy with many tiny black seeds.Kiwi plants can reach a height of 9 m (30 ft) and have an economic lifespan of 3 years, after which time fruit production begins to decline.Kiwi may also be referred to as kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry and originates from China.Kiwi vines Kiwi leaf Kiwi fruit Developing leaves Kiwi flowers Kiwi plant Uses Kiwis are primarily consumed as a fresh fruit.
Kiwi Content Propagation Basic requirements Kiwi plants are native to warm, forest regions of China and require a long growing season with 8 to 9 month with no frost. The optimal temperature during the growing season is between 14 and 24Â°C (57.2â€“75.2Â°F).The plant can tolerate cold but is damaged by temperatures below -8Â°C (17.6Â°F).Some varieties of A.deliciosa , such as the Hayward cultivar will tolerate temperatures down to -10Â°C (14Â°F).In general, kiwifruit vines will grow best when planted in deep, well-draining, sandy loams as they are extremely sensitive to standing water.The optimum pH for the soil is between 5.5 and 6.0.In addition, kiwifruits require a plentiful supply of water during production and the vines require the support of a trellis to support the weight of the growing fruit.Kiwi should be planted in full sunlight to ensure optimal productivity.
Propagation Kiwis can be propagated by a variety of methods, including growing from seed or from hard or softwood cuttings or root cuttings. The easiest method of propagation is the use of softwood cuttings.The cuttings should be taken during the summer months when the tree is actively growing.Each cutting should be taken from the current seasonâ€™s growth and should possess 2-3 nodes (leaves).The leaves must be fully expanded in order for the cutting to be successful, cuttings should not be taken from immature growth such as at the end of shoots.once the cuttings have been obtained, they should be stripped of all but the top-most leaf.Rooting hormone can be used to aid the cuttings in developing new roots.Those containing indole-3-butyric acid have been shown to be most effective in kiwi propagation.After treatment with rooting hormone, the kiwi cuttings should be planted in beds or small pots, preferably in a glasshouse, and kept moist.
When the cuttings have began to develop new shoots, they should be transferred into 1 gallon pots containing a high quality potting soil and watered daily. The potted plants should be fed with a slow release fertilizer at least twice over the growing season.Planting If the kiwi vines are to be grown on a trellis or pergola, this should be constructed prior to planting.Kiwi should be planted by digging a planting hole which is at least three times the width of the current pot that the plant is in.Individual plants should typically be spaced 5 m (16.4 ft) apart when using a T-trellis system but can be planted closer together when vines are managed by pruning.Approximately 6 m (19.6 ft) should be left between rows.This distance is again dependent on the training system being utilized.Almost all kiwi species are dioecious and require the presence of both a male and female tree in order to set fruit.
The recommended planting ratio is 1 male to every 8 females but a higher density of male trees will increase productivity. General care and maintenance Kiwis have a high nutrient demand, particularly for nitrogen and potassium.after the first year of planting, plants should be fertilized in the Spring and as required throughout the growing season with the type and amount of fertilizer depending on the particular soil type and the age of the vines.References Morton, J.F.(2013).Fruits of warm climates.Echo Point Books & Media.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/kiwifruit_ars.html.[Accessed 31 January 15] Free to access Powell, A.A.(1998).Kiwifruit propagation.Auburn University.Available at: http://www.aces.edu/dept/peaches/kiwiprop.html.

gongylodes , is an herbaceous biennial grown for its edible stem. The kohlrabi plant has an erect stem which is swollen at the bottom, close to the soil.The swelling resembles a turnip in appearance, can reach up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and may be green, white or purple in color depending on the variety.The leaves of the plant grow from the stem and have long petioles and a waxy appearance.Kohlrabi can grow to a height of 40â€“50 cm (16â€“20 in) and although biennial, is commonly grown as an annual.Kohlrabi may also be referred to as turnip-rooted cabbage or German cabbage and originates from Europe.Kohlrabi Kohlrabi leaf Kohlrabi plant Kohlrabi close-up Kohlrabi plant Kohlrabi stem and leaves Uses The kohlrabi stem is consumed after cooking as a vegetable.The leaves of the plant are also edible and are eaten after cooking similar to spinach or kale.Kohlrabi Content Propagation Basic requirements Kohlrabi a cool season crop which can be grown both in Spring and in Fall.
The plants thrive in cool climates, maturing in cool or lightly frosty weather. In areas with hot summers, they should be planted for a Fall harvest.Kohlrabi will grow best in moist, fertile, well-draining soil with a slightly acidic pH between between 6.0 and 6.8 and at temperatures between 7 and 24Â°C (45â€“75Â°F).Temperatures below 7Â°C (45Â°F) will cause the plants to bolt.Kohlrabi has a high nitrogen requirement and due to the reduced activity of soil microbes in late fall and winter, organic matter should be added to the soil throughout the year to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients when sprouts are planted.Plant kohlrabi in an area that receives at least six hours of full sunlight for optimum growth and development.Propagation Kohlrabi can be direct seeded in the garden or started indoors to produce transplants.Seeds and transplants can be planted outdoors 1 to 2 weeks prior to the last frost date.
For fall plantings, time seeding/transplanting so that plants mature no more than 2 to 3 weeks after the first frost date for the region. Seeds should be sown 0.6-1.9 in (0.25-0.75 in) deep.Direct seeded plants should be thinned when the plants have 3-4 true leaves.Transplants and thinned seedling should have a final spacing of 15 cm (6 in) between plants and 30.5 cm (12 in) between rows.General care and maintenance Kohlrabi has a shallow root system and should be watered regularly to keep the plants from drying out.Aim to apply 1 to 2 inches of water per week.Application of organic mulches will help to conserve water and keep the soil cool.Fertilizing kohlrabi plants with an appropriate nitrogen fertilizer helps to ensure rapid plant growth.Kohlrabi beds should be kept free from weeds, particularly when plants are young, by cultivating the soil around the plants.Care should be taken to avoid damage to the root system.
Harvesting Kohlrabi is ready to harvest when the stems reach 5 to 7.6 cm (2-3 in) in diameter. Stems harvested later tend to be tough and woody.Young leaves can be harvested during the growing season and prepared in the same way as kale.References Drost, D.& Johnson, M.(2010).Kohlrabi in the garden.Utah State Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/HG_Garden_2005-06.pdf.[Accessed 02 February 15].Free to access .

Lavender plants are small, branching and spreading shrubs with grey-green leaves and long flowering shoots. The leaves can be simple or pinnate measuring 30â€“50 mm (1â€“2 in) in length.The plant produces flowers on shoots or spikes which can be 20â€“40 cm (8â€“16 in) long.The flowers are lilac or blue in color.Lavender can grow to 0.4 m (1.3 ft) in height and live for 20â€“30 years.Lavender may also be referred to as true lavender, medical lavender, smelling lavender, thin-leaved lavender or English lavender and is believed to originate from the Mediterranean, Middle East and India.Lavender Lavender flowerheads Lavender flowering Uses Lavender flowers can be used in cooking as a herb or used to produce lavender sugar.Fresh flowers can be used as a flavoring in desserts and sauces.Bees which collect lavender nectar produce a high quality honey.Lavender is also cultivated as an ornamental plant or for the extraction of essential oil.
The flower spikes are popularly dried and used in flower arranging. Lavender Content Propagation Basic requirements Lavender grows very well in a wide range of climates, and optimally at temperatures between 7 and 21Â°C (44.6â€“69.8Â°F).Lavender plants require bright sunlight for adequate growth and should be positioned accordingly.The plants will grow best in light to sandy, well-draining soils with a pH of 5.8â€“8.3.The plants are drought tolerant once established but require regular watering while they establish.Propagation Lavender is usually propagated vegetatively from cuttings or by dividing the mother plant.Cuttings are best taken directly after the plants bloom.The cuttings should be taken from stems with no flower buds and should be prepared for planting by removing the leaves at the bottom of the stem.The cuttings should then be planted in pots containing a high quality, sterile potting soil and watered regularly until they root.
the cuttings should develop a root system of their own in approximately 3 weeks. Planting Lavender plants can be planted Spring through to Fall.If planting in the Fall, care should be taken to use larger plants with an established root system to allow the plants to establish in the soil quickly before winter sets in.Spring planted lavender can be smaller as it can establish over the summer.Rooted cuttings can be planted directly in the garden after they have been hardened.Plants should be spaced 0.5â€“1.0 m (2â€“3 ft) apart depending on the variety, allowing 1â€“2 m (3â€“6 ft) between rows.General care and maintenance Once established, lavender requires little care.It benefits from prompt harvest if the flowers are to be used for further processing.Faded blooms should be removed to promote further blossoming.Light pruning encourages the plant to branch.Care should be taken not to over water the plants by allowing the plants to dry out between waterings.
Harvesting Flowerheads can be harvested from the plant at any time. Flowerheads to be used for the extraction of essential oil are best harvested when only 1/2 to 1/3 of the florets are open.Harvesting is usually done by hand but may be achieved mechanically in commercial production.after harvest, the flowers should be hung upside down in bunches to dry out.Commercially grown lavender References Adam, K.L.(2006).Lavender production, products, markets and entertainment farms.National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service.[Accessed 31 January 15].Free to access .Geisel, P.M., Unruh, C.L.& Lawson, P.L.(2004).Lavenders for California Gardens.University of California Division ofAgriculture and Natural Resources.[Accessed 31 January 15].Free to access .Kimbrough, K.A.& and Swift, C.E.Growing Lavender in Colorado.Colorado State University Extension.Available at: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07245.pdf.[Accessed 31 January 15].Free to access .

The plant can reach 0.6â€“0.9 m (2â€“3 ft) and can be grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season or as a biennial with two growing seasons.Although modern leek does not grow wild, it was likely domesticated from wild ancestors in the Mediterranean region.Leek blossom Harvested leeks Leek scape (flower bud) Growing leeks Leek foliage Leeks Uses Leeks are consumed as a vegetable after cooking and are incorporated into many dishes.Leek Content Propagation Basic requirements Leeks grow very well in cool climates and can be successfully grown in most soils as long as they are rich and well draining.Leek will grow optimally in a well-draining loam with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0.Leek will grow optimally at temperatures between 18-21Ë š C (65-70Ë š F) with 8 hours of bright sunlight.
Propagation In areas with short growing seasons, leeks should be planted from transplants started indoors. Seeds should be planted at a depth of 0.6-1.3 cm (0.25-0.5 in) leaving 7.5-10 cm (3-4 in) between plants and allowing 20-40 cm (8-16 in) between rows.The soil should be moist to a depth of (18 in) and have reached a minimum temperature of 7Ë š C (45Ë š F) for successful germination.Transplants should be planted 5-8 cm (2-6 in) apart in rows spaced 30-90 cm (12-36 in) apart.In order to produce large stalks either plant the leek in a depression 7-10 cm (3-4 in) deep and gradually fill to the leaves.Alternatively, the leeks may be planted at ground level, with soil being added around the stalk throughout the season.General care and maintenance Leeks require regular watering for optimum development and should be provided with water once a week by soaking the soil to a depth of around 18 inches.Blanching leeks encourages the production of long white stalks.
Blanching is achieved by gradually mounding the soil around the stalk to leaves. Blanching should not be carried out until the plants have reached an appropriate size - roughly that of a pencil.Leeks will benefit from the addition of nitrogen fertilizer throughout the growing season.fertilizer should be applied as a side dressing.Keep leek beds weed free by carefully cultivating around the plants taking care not to damage the leek roots.Harvesting Leeks develop slowly and take about 100 and 120 days to reach maturity.Leeks are ready for harvest when the stalk has reach 3.5 cm (1 in) in diameter.Harvest by carefully loosening the plant with a garden fork and pulling from the soil.References Anderson, C.R.Leeks.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-6070.pdf.[Accessed 07 February 15] Free to access .Drost, D.(2010).Leeks in the garden.Utah State Cooperative Extension.

The grass grows in dense clumps and has several stiff stems and slender blade-like leaves which droop towards the tips. The leaves are blue-green in color, turning red in the Fall and emit a strong lemon fragrance when damaged.Lemongrass produces large compound flowers on spikes when grown in the tropics, but rarely flowers when grown in more Northern latitudes.Lemon grass can reach a height of 1.8 m (6 ft) and will grow for several years, typically its economical lifespan is 4 years.Lemongrass may also be referred to as ginger grass or citronella grass and likely originates from Sri Lanka or Malaysia although a wild form of the plant is not known.Lemon grass stems Lemon grass leaves Lemon grass Uses The stalks (leaf bases) of the plant are commonly used to flavor dishes in Southeast Asian cooking.The heart of young shoots may be cooked and consumed as a vegetable.The tougher leaves are used to flavor dishes but are typically removed before serving.
Leaves may also be used to make lemon grass tea. The essential oil extracted from the leaves is commonly used in insect repellents, perfumes and soaps.Lemon grass Content Propagation Basic requirements Lemongrass is a tropical plant and as such will grow best in warm, sunny and humid conditions of the tropics and subtropics.The plants can be grown at temperatures ranging from 10 to 33Â°C (50-91.4Â°F) but will grow optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30Â°C (77â€“86Â°F).The grass will grow in a wide range of soils but grows best in well-draining, fertile loam with a pH between 5.0 and 8.4.The grass can also be successfully grown in containers.Plants can be successfully grown in full sun or partial shade.Propagation As a clumping grass, lemongrass can be easily propagated by dividing stalks from the rhizome of a well established plant.The rhizome is best divided in the Spring in areas where the plant can be overwintered outdoors.
In colder areas, the bulbous shoot base can be saved after harvest and stored for use the following Spring. The bulb can be divided prior to planting by slicing through the rhizome with a sharp spade or trowel.Ensure that each new plant has its own rootstock.Planting Commercially grown lemongrass is planted at a higher density than in the home garden with a within row spacing of 20 cm (8 in) and 40 cm (16 in).In the home garden, plants should be spaced between 90 and 150 cm (36-60 in) apart.Prepare the soil for planting by working in 2 to 4 inches of compost.General care and maintenance Lemongrass requires regular rainfall and if being grown in drier climates the plants should be watered and misted regularly.Plants have a heavy requirement for nitrogen during the growing season and should be fertilized with a balanced soluble fertilizer once a month.Container grown plants should be fed more frequently.Lemongrass can grow very large and will quickly out compete weeds.
However, younger plants should be kept free by carefully cultivating or hand pulling any weeds from around the plants. Harvesting Lemongrass can be harvested at any time once the stalks have reached 1.3 cm (0.5 in) in diameter.Harvest stalks by cutting them at ground level with a sharp knife, or by bending the stalk and twisting.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Cymbopogon citratus (citronella grass) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/17377.[Accessed 10 February 15].Paid subscription required .Gilman, E.F.(1999).Cymbopogon citratus.University of Florida IFAS Extension.Available at: http://hort.ufl.edu/database/documents/pdf/shrub_fact_sheets/cymcita.pdf.[Accessed 10 February 15].Free to access Linse, T.& Drost, D.Lemongrass.University of Florida IFAS Extension.Available at: http://nassau.ifas.ufl.edu/horticulture/demogarden/printables/Lemongrass.pdf.[Accessed 10 February 15].

The tree has a spreading, upright growth habit, few large branches and stiff thorns. The tree possesses large, oblong or oval, light green leaves and produces purple-white flowers in clusters.The lemon fruit is an ellipsoid berry surrounded by a green rind, which ripens to yellow, protecting soft yellow segmented pulp.Lemon trees can reach 3â€“6 m (10â€“20 ft) in height and can live for many years, reaching full fruit bearing capacity in approximately 40 years.Lemon may also be referred to as bush lemon or Persian apple and likely originated from the eastern Himalaya of India.Seeds inside fruit Fruit Lemon tree Fruit sliced open to reveal flesh Cluster of lemon fruits Lemon fruit ripening on tree Uses Due to their bitter taste, lemon fruit is not usually consumed fresh.It is used widely to make juices such as lemonade, as garnishes in cooking and as a flavoring in cooking and baking.
Lemon Content Propagation Requirements Lemon is a subtropical plant and the trees grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season. They will grow best at temperatures between 26â€“28Â°C (79â€“82Â°F) and are very sensitive to cold.Trees and fruit will be damaged or killed by freezing conditions without protection.The trees will tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil.Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development.Lemon trees will grow best when positioned in full sunlight.Budding Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6â€“9 mm/0.25â€“0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant).
Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined.It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees.The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees.The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves.These budsticks can be stored for 2â€“3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding.The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground.
Using a sharp knife, a 2.5â€“3.8 cm (1â€“1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a â€œT-shapeâ€​ The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark.Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud.This piece should measure 1.9â€“2.5 cm(0.75â€“1.0 in) in length.Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant.Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.After the union has formed and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem 2.5â€“3.9 cm (1.0â€“1.5 in) above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem on the same side as the join.
The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as â€œloppingâ€​ allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in lengthe, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.Planting seedlings Lemon trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard.The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area.Trees should be planted at or higher than the level of the nursery pot.Once the tree is positioned in the planting hole, backfill the soil by about half and water to allow the soil to settle around the lower roots before filling in the hole.The newly planted tree should be watered every few days.General care Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established.
During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3â€“7 days.The soil should be moist, but not wet.Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently.Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year.Lemon trees will need protected from cold temperatures to prevent damage.Soil can be mounded up around the trunk during the winter and removed in the Spring.Young trees can also be protected from frosts by covering them with tarps or blankets as required.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Citrus limon (lemon) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13450.[Accessed 10 February 15].Paid subscription required .Lacey, K., Ramsey, H.& Hoffman, H.(2009).Growing healthy citrus.Department of Agriculture and Food.

often produce abundant quantities of white spores Mushrooms of Armillaria Symptoms Trees may wilt suddenly and collapse or decline slowly; leaves become chlorotic and drop from tree; if large parts of root are destroyed then whole canopy is affected; trunk may have area of rotting bark at the base; lesions on the trunk resemble Phytophthora gummosis; clusters of mushrooms may be present at the bottom of the tree and fan shaped mycelial mats are often present between the bark and the wood. Cause Fungus Comments Healthy trees are usually infected by infected pieces of wood or tree stumps which have been left in the ground after an orchard is cleared.
Management Disease is difficult to control once it becomes established in an orchard; affected trees showing signs of decline should be removed along with as much of the roots system as possible; area where infected tree was should not be replanted with health citrus for a period of at least one year; fumigating soil can help to reduce soil inoculum but is not always completely effective. Black root rot Thielaviopsis basicola Symptoms Small brown-black lesions on roots which may coalesce and turn entire root black; root cortex may slough off to reveal the vascular tissue below; leaves of plant may be chlorotic.Cause Fungus Comments Serious disease of glasshouse grown citrus trees; pathogen usually drops to non-damaging levels after tree is transplanted to the field.Management Keep glasshouses well lit and warm during winter to encourage vigorous root growth; use good quality potting soil which provides good aeration.
Mal secco Phoma tracheiphila Discolored wood on lemon tree infected with mal secco Lemon tree infected with mal secco Lemon tree infected with mal secco Symptoms Chlorosis of leaf veins; wilting leaves which drop from plant; the midrib of fallen leaves may have a red discoloration; infected bark may turn silver-grey in color. Cause Fungus Comments Disease a major problem in citrus growing areas in Mediterranean.Management Spread of the disease into new areas can be prevented through the use of clean planting material; if trees become infected, diseased shoots and branches should be pruned out as soon as possible; avoif over head irrigation; trees can be protected from the disease by spraying with copper fungicides.
Category : Bacterial Bacterial canker (Blast) Pseudomonas syringae Symptoms Water-soaked or black lesions on leaf petioles;which rapidly expand along the leif midrib; cankers on twigs and branches; twigs may be girdles and die; leaves turning black and dying; black lesions may be present on fruit. Cause Bacterium Comments Symptoms most severe on south facing side of tree exposed to winds.Management In areas where disease is severe, copper fungicides should be applied in Fall and WInter prior to the first rains.Citrus canker Xanthomonas axonopodis Symptoms on fruit Symptoms on leaves Symptoms Raised lesions on leaves, often at leaf margin or tip; lesions may also be present on twigs and fruits; young lesions are usually surrounded by yellow halo; depressed brown craters formed from collapse of lesions.Cause Bacterium Comments Bacteria survive in lesions; the main method of spread is via wind driven rain; bacteria may enter through pruning wounds.
Management If the disease is introduced to an area, all infected trees should be removed and destroyed; in areas where disease is endemic, windbreaks can help to reduce disease severity; cultural control of the disease should focus on controlling leaf miner populations, utilizing wind breaks and applications of copper sprays. Huanglongbing (Citrus greening, Yellow dragon disease) Candidatus Liberibacter asiativus Candidatus Liberibacter africanus Candidatus Liberibacter americanus citrus greening (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) infected leaves Symptoms of citrus greening (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) citrus greening (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) symptoms Symptoms Yellowing of one limb or one area of canopy; yellowing of leaf veins; blotchy mottling on leaf blades; twig and limb dieback; fruits dropping prematurely; small upwardly pointing leaves; small, misshapen fruit; fruit very bitter.
Cause Bacteria Comments History Origins and spread Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a â€œyellow shootâ€​ disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s.Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of â€œhuang long bingâ€​, which translates to â€œyellow dragon diseaseâ€​, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees.
By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - â€œgreeningâ€​ in South Africa, â€œmottle leafâ€​ in the Philippines, â€œdiebackâ€​ in India and â€œvein phloem degenerationâ€​ in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia.Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant.
The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L.africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C.A third species, L.asiaticus , found in .A third species, L.americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements.As this species is found in the same areas as L.asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements.Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting.
The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew.Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head.Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed.They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers.When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days.
In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments.Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices.The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956.The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured.
Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus.Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed.Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified.In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms.(ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays.Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T.eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk.
In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.Category : Viral Tristeza disease Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) Symptoms Light green foliage; poor new growth; leaves may be dropping from tree; young trees blooming early; severely infected trees are stunted and bushy in appearance with chlorotic leaves and brittle twigs; some strains of the virus cause elongated pits in the trunk and branches which give the wood a rope-like appearance.Cause Virus Comments Disease spread from infected grafting material or by aphids.Management Quarantine procedures are used to control tristeza and prevent the pathogen from entering areas which are currently free of the disease.
Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Black citrus aphid, Brown citrus aphid) Toxoptera aurantii Toxoptera citricida Brown citrus aphids on leaves Brown citrus aphid (Toxoptera citricida) Symptoms Leaves curling; leaves and twigs covered in sticky substance which may be growing sooty mold; trees may show symptoms of tristeza (see entry); insects are small and soft bodied and are black in color. Cause Insect Comments Aphids transmit tristeza virus on citrus.Management Aphid numbers tend to naturally decline as leaves harden off but can be a problem on young trees or varieties which continually produce flushes of new growth; pesticides are not generally recommended due to resistance and trees can withstand a high degree of leaf curling.
Citrus leaf miner Phyllocnistis citrella Tunneling caused by leaf miner Citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella) damaged leaves Leaf curling distortion from citrus leafminer injury Leafminer damage Symptoms Thin, winding trails on leaves; heavy infestation can result in curled and distorted leaves; adult leafminer is a tiny moth which lays its eggs in the leaf; larvae hatch and feed on leaf interior. Cause Insect Comments Leaf miners attack flushes of young growth and are unable to enter leaves once they harden.Management Insecticide application are rarely warranted in mature orchards as yields are unaffected; young trees should be treated with appropriate insecticides to prevent retarded growth; cultural control methods include removal of water sprouts from trees and refraining from pruning live branches more than once a year to encourage uniform growth flushes which are short in duration.

The leaves of the plant are arranged alternately and are made up of 4â€“7 individual oval leaflets.The plant produces small blue, purple, white or pink flowers arranged on racemes with 1â€“4 flowers.The seeds, or lentils, are produced within rhomboidal pods and can range in size from 2-9 mm (0.1â€“0.3 in) in diameter depending on the variety and can be red-orange, yellow, green or black in color.There are generally 1â€“2 lentils per pod.Lentil plants can reach 15â€“75 cm (6â€“30 in) in height and as annuals, survive only one growing season.Lentil may also be referred to as red dhal or split pea and its origin is unknown although it is grown widely in Europe, Asia, and North Africa.Lentil plants growing in a field Uses The lentil seeds can be eaten raw or are cooked and eaten in soups and other dishes.They are commonly eaten as dahl (lentils seeds which have had the husk removed and then split).
Lentil seeds can be used as a source of starch for the textile industry or can be ground into flour. The youger pods are sometimes eaten as vegetables.Lentil Content Split red lentils Propagation Basic requirements Lentils are adapted to grow in cool climates and are tolerant of some light frost.Lentil plants can be grown on a wide variety of soils from sandy soils to clay loams but will grow optimally in a sandy, well-draining soil with a pH of 4.5 to 8.2.A soil pH of close to 7 is ideal.Lentils will be killed by waterlogged soil so good drainage is very important.Growing lentils on a South or East facing slope will help to warm the crop early in the growing season.The optimum temperature for their growth is approximately 24Â°C (75Â°F).Lentils require and average rainfall of 10 to 12 inches per year but are fairly tolerant of drought although yield will be reduced.Yield will also be reduced by high humidity which promotes vegetative growth.
Propagation Lentils are propagated by seed and are either sown by broadcasting or by drilling in rows. Seed should be sown in soil which is firm and which has been prepared to a fine tilth.Seeds should be planted planted at a depth of 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in), leaving 20â€“30 cm (7.8â€“12 in) between individual plants and 15â€“18 cm (6â€“7 in) between rows.Due to the small size of the seeds, seedlings struggle to emerge if planted too deep in the soil.Commercial fields are planted at a rates of between 30 and 80 kg of seed per acre, depending on the variety, when lentil is the sole crop being grown.The best yields are achieved when lentil is planted by drilling which ensures a uniform planting depth.In many countries where lentil is commercially produced, lentils are intercropped with crops such as rice or barley and seeding rates are reduced accordingly.General care and maintenance Lentil seeds are often inoculated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria prior to planting.
These bacteria nodulate the plants, allowing them to fix atmospheric nitrogen. found in the soil.lentils should be inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum within 24 hours of planting if the planting field was not previously used to grow lentils or other legumes.If the nitrogen level in the soil is low at time of planting then an early nitrogen supplement should be applied at a rate of 30 to 40 lb per acre.This ensures that the seedlings have enough nitrogen while the root nodules develop.Lentils have high requirements for sulfur, potassium and phosphorous and a soil test should be used to establish the level on these nutrients in the soil and thus the rate at which they should be applied if the soil is found to be deficient.Optimum soil tests range 15 to 30 ppm (30 to 60 lb/acre) for P and 90 to 120 ppm (180 to 240 lb/acre) for K for most soils.Lentils do not compete well with weeds and the planting site should be cleared by hoeing prior to the seeds being planted.
Lentils should be kept evenly moist and watering should be ceased when the pods have begun to dry out. Harvesting Lentils are ready to harvest when the plants turn yellow and the lower seed pods are yellow-brown in color.Plants should be watched carefully as this will happen over a period of a few days and the pods are easily shattered if left too long on the plants.Commercially grown lentil is harvested by swathing and the pods are threshed to collect the seeds.In the home garden, the pods can be picked from the plants or the whole plant can be gently pulled from the ground and set to dry on a rack for 1 to 2 weeks.The seeds can then be extracted from the dried pods by breaking them open and removing the seeds.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Lens culinaris subsp.culinaris (lentil) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/30274.[Accessed 11 February 15].Paid subscription required .Chen, W., Sharma, H.C.& Muehlbauer, F.J.(Eds.)

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Anthracnose Colletotrichum truncatum Symptoms Tan lesions with darker borders on leaves which often appear prior to flowering or shortly after bloom; diseased leaves may drop from the plant prematurely; tan to light brown lesions appear on lower stems and begin to spread upwards, appearing higher on the plant; lesions may contain numerous black dots; as plant matures, the lesions expand and may cover large areas of the stem; lesions may also be present on pods and are light to tan brown with a dark margin; diseased pods often produced discolored seeds; disease can cause severe losses in yield Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by wet conditions; fungus is spread by splashing water; faba beans and filed peas are alternate hosts for the fungus Management There are no varieties of lentil which are completely resistant to the disease but some are less susceptible than others and can be planted in areas where disease is prevalent; a well-timed application of an appropriate fungicide may be enough to control the disease but should be reapplied in the event of persistent wet weather Ascochyta blight Ascochyta pinodella Ascochyta lesions on lentil leaf Ascochyta symptoms on lentil plant Symptoms Tan to light brown lesions with a dark border can appear an any aerial part of the plant (leaves, stems, pods, petioles, peduncles); during periods of high humidity, numerous black dots may be visible in the center of the lesions; diseased plants may abort flowers and/or fruits; seeds may be discolored Cause Fungus Comments Disease can be transmitted to seedlings from infected seeds; foliar transmission is favored by cool, moist soils Management Plant only disease-free seed or seed treated with a fungicide prior to planting; rotate crop away from lentil for a period of three years; remove and destroy all lentil crop residue after harvest to reduce the levels of inoculum the following growing season; a single application of an appropriate foliar fungicide is usually enough to control the disease but should be reapplied during persistent wet weather Powdery mildew Erysiphe pisi Symptoms Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; powdery gray-white areas which coalesce to cover entire plant; if plant is heavily infected it may appear light blue or gray in color Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters on plant debris or alternate host; disease emergence is favored by warm, dry weather with cool nights that result in dew formation Management Plant resistant varieties, particularly if sowing late; use overhead irrigation (washes fungus from leaves and reduces viability); plant crop as early as possible; frequent applications of sulfur may be required to control heavy infestations Pests Category : Insects Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Category : Others Damping-off Pythium ultimum Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Failure of seedling to emerge; light brown, seedlings with light brown to redwater-soaked roots and stems; collapse of plants; plant dry up and die; stunted plant growth; rotting taproot with few lateral roots Cause Fungi Comments Occurs more often in cold temperatures when growth of seedlings is slow and in moist soil Management Treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting Fusarium wilt Fusarium oxysporum Symptoms Weak and wilting leaf stems, leaves and flowers; lower leaves drying out and dying; leaves turning brown or pale yellow; splitting the stem reveals discoloration of the inner tissue; leaves turn dull yellow in color and collapse; disease appears in fields in patches Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors warm, moist soils; disease can be spread by water splash, movement of infected soil and plants and by infected seed Management The primary method of controlling the disease is to use resistant varieties; damage can be reduced by application of appropriate fungicides; crop debris should be removed or plowed deeply into the soil after harvest; if disease is present in the soil then a rotation to a non-host for a period of three years can reduce the levels of inoculum in the soil Gray mold Botrytis cinerea Symptoms Plants turning yellow and wilting; diseased tissue covered with fuzzy gray fungal growth during periods of high humidity; lesions may girdle the stem and cause the upper canopy to die; if the disease does not girdle the stem, the upper leaves remain green and the lower canopy becomes necrotic Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by cool, wet conditions and dense canopies which pro,mote high humidity in the lower canopy; disease can be transmitted by infected seed or from infested crop debris from the previos year Management Plant only pathogen-free seed or seed treated with an appropriate fungicide prior to planting; avoid planting lentils in fields or areas adjacent to fields which had an outbreak of gray mold the previous year; remove and destroy lentil crop residue after harvest; applications of appropriate fungicides can be helpful for controlling the disease Mosaic Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) Symptoms Mottled dark and light green patterns on leaves; leaves may be distorted; yellow dots may be present on leaves; growth of plant may be reduced Cause Virus Comments Viruses are transmitted by aphids Management Plant virus-free seed; plant resistant varieties Sclerotinia rot Sclerotinia rolfsii Symptoms Lesions girdle stem causing upper plant parts to become chlorotic and wilted; plants become necrotic after they die; disease often causes a patchwork of symptomatic plants throughout a field with plants initially becoming chlorotic and finally dying; fungus causes characteristic white lesions on stems which may be covered in a fluffy white growth during periods of wet weather Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by cool, wet conditions and a dense canopy which promotes high humidity Management About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms A long rotation to small grains can help to reduce the levels of inoculum in the soil;

The lettuce plant can vary greatly in size, shape and leaf type but generally, the leaves of the plant form a dense head or loose rosette. The stem of the plant is short, with larger leaves arranged at the bottom and becoming progressively smaller further up the stem.Leaves can be smooth or curly and are usually green or red in color.The lettuce plant can grow to a height of 30â€“100 cm (12â€“40 in) in height and is typically grown as an annual, harvested after only one growing season.Lettuce may be referred to as garden lettuce and is believed to originate from Asia Minor and the Middle East.Close-up of lettuce leaves Red leaf lettuce Heads of lettuce Iceberg lettuce Red leaf lettuce Head of lettuce Uses Lettuce is primarily eaten raw as a salad green.Some varieties can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.Lettuce Content Propagation Requirements Lettuce is a cool season crop which will grow optimally at daytime temperatures of 15â€“20Â°C (59â€“68Â°F).
The plant can be grown in a wide range of soils as long as it is fertile and moisture retaining due to the small root system of the plant. It is often grown in alkaline soil (pH greater than 7.0) but will not tolerate acid soil.Heat tolerant varieties can be grown over the summer months and care should be taken to protect the leaves from strong sun by shading or covering to prevent the plants from bolting.Sowing seeds Lettuce seeds can be sown directly in the garden or field as soon as the soil can be worked as the seeds will germinate at temperatures of 4.4Â°C (40Â°F) and above and seedlings will tolerate a light frost.Seeds should be sown 0.3â€“0.6 cm (1/8â€“1/4 in) deep and 2.5 cm (1 in) apart, leaving 50 cm (20 in) between rows.Cover the seeds lightly, tamp the soil and water the seeds.Seedlings should emerge in 2â€“15 days.When the plants have 2â€“3 true leaves then they should be thinned to a final spacing of 25â€“45 cm (10 to 18 in) depending on the variety.
Plant new seeds every 2â€“3 weeks for a continuous harvest. Transplants Sow seeds in seedling trays in a sterile seed starting mix at a rate of approximately 3â€“4 seeds per inch (2.5 cm).Young plants can be potted up into larger pots or cell trays when they are about 2 weeks old.Plant transplants in the garden after hardening off, spacing plants 25â€“45 cm (10 to 18 in) (depending on variety) and allowing 50 cm (20 in) between rows.Plant new seeds every 2â€“3 weeks for a continuous harvest.Lettuce seedlings References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Lactuca sativa (lettuce) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/29609.[Accessed 10 February 15].Paid subscription required .Davis, R.M., Subbarao, K.V., Raid, R.N.& and Kurtz, E.A.(Eds.)

The lime tree is irregularly branched and possesses sharp spines. The leaves of the tree are elliptical with small rounded teeth around the edge.The leaves can grow 4â€“8 cm (1.6â€“3.2 in) in length.The tree produces small, cupped white flowers and yellowish-green fruit which is round or egg-like in shape.Lime trees can reach 5 m (16 ft) in height and can produce fruit for many years.Lime may also be referred to as sour lime, key lime, Mexican lime, acid lime or West Indian lime and originated in southeast Asia.Harvested limes Lime fruit close-up Lime blossom Limes sliced open Lime fruit growing on the tree Lime fruits on the tree Uses Lime fruit is commonly used to make juices and cordials or for extraction of citric acid.It may be used as a flavoring in cooking.Lime oil can be extracted from the peel of the fruit.
Lime, sour Content Propagation Requirements Lime is a tropical plant and the trees grow best in regions with hot summers and warm winters where temperatures are typically between 25 and 30Â°C (77â€“86Â°F). Limes are more sensitive to cold than lemons and trees are killed by freezing conditions without protection.Lime trees are the most drought tolerant of all citrus trees conditions and will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development.Lime trees will grow best when positioned in full sunlight.Lime propagation Unlike many other fruit bearing trees, limes are commonly propagated from seed as the will produce offspring that is true to the parent plant.In some cases, trees are propagated by removing offshoots from the main trunk (called suckers) and replanting although, if the tree is grafted, it should be noted that the suckers will be the same variety of the rootstock.
Planting seedlings The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Trees should be planted at or higher than the level of the nursery pot.Once the tree is positioned in the planting hole, backfill the soil by about half and water to allow the soil to settle around the lower roots before filling in the hole.The newly planted tree should be watered every few days.General care Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established.During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil.Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3â€“7 days.The soil should be moist, but not wet.Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently.Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year.Lime trees will need protected from cold temperatures to prevent damage.
Soil can be mounded up around the trunk during the winter and removed in the Spring. Trees can also be protected by stringing christmas lights in the branches and covering the leaves with tarps.In areas with cold winters, lime trees are best grown in containers which allows them to be moved indoors during the winter months.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Citrus aurantiifolia (lime) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13438.[Accessed 10 February 15].Paid subscription required .Gilman, E.F.& Watson, D.G.(1993).Citrus.University of Florida.Available at: http://hort.ufl.edu/database/documents/pdf/tree_fact_sheets/citsppa.pdf.[Accessed 10 February 15].Free to access .Morton, J.(1987).Mexican lime.In Fruits of warm climates.Creative Resource Systems, Inc.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/mexican_lime.html.[Accessed 10 February 15].Free to access .Timmer, L.W., Garnsey, S.M.& Graham, J.H.(2000).Compendium of Citrus Diseases.

Armillaria mycelial mat Symptoms Trees may wilt suddenly and collapse or decline slowly; leaves become chlorotic and drop from tree; if large parts of root are destroyed then whole canopy is affected; trunk may have area of rotting bark at the base; lesions on the trunk resemble Phytophthora gummosis; clusters of mushrooms may be present at the bottom of the tree and fan shaped mycelial mats are often present between the bark and the wood. Cause Fungus Comments Healthy trees are usually infected by infected pieces of wood or tree stumps which have been left in the ground after an orchard is cleared.Management Disease is difficult to control once it becomes established in an orchard; affected trees showing signs of decline should be removed along with as much of the roots system as possible; area where infected tree was should not be replanted with health citrus for a period of at least one year; fumigating soil can help to reduce soil inoculum but is not always completely effective.
Black root rot Thielaviopsis basicola Symptoms Small brown-black lesions on roots which may coalesce and turn entire root black; root cortex may slough off to reveal the vascular tissue below; leaves of plant may be chlorotic. Cause Fungus Comments Serious disease of glasshouse grown citrus trees; pathogen usually drops to non-damaging levels after tree is transplanted to the field.Management Keep glasshouses well lit and warm during winter to encourage vigorous root growth; use good quality potting soil which provides goo aeration.Blast Psuedomonas syringae Symptoms Water-soaked or black lesions on leaf petioles;which rapidly expand along the leif midrib; cankers on twigs and branches; twigs may be girdles and die; leaves turning black and dying; black lesions may be present on fruit.Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors wet, cool and windy weather.
Management In areas where disease is severe, copper fungicides should be applied in Fall and WInter prior to the first rains. Melanose Diaporthe citri Symptoms of Diaporthe citri on citrus twig.The pycnidial conidiomata are visible.Melanose (Diaporthe citri) infected fruit Symptoms Small brown sunken spots which become raised and surrounded by a yellow halo; lesions eventually turn corky in texture; severe infections can cause newly emerging leaves to be crinkled and distorted; if infection of fruit occurs soon after petal fall, the pathogen causes large lesions on the fruit surface which may coalesce to produce large patches; late infection of fruit causes discrete pustules on the fruit.Cause Fungus Comments Disease is spread short distance through splashing water or over longer distances by wind.
Management If young trees become infected, it is possible to control the disease by pruning but this is not usually feasible for older trees; fungicides must be applied frequently in order to control the disease. Category : Bacterial Citrus canker Xanthomonas axonopodis Leaves symptom of citrus canker (Xanthomonas citri) Twig symptoms of citrus canker (Xanthomonas citri) Symptoms Raised lesions on leaves, often at leaf margin or tip; lesions may also be present on twigs and fruits; young lesions are usually surrounded by yellow halo; depressed brown craters formed from collapse of lesions.Cause Bacterium Comments Can cause serious economic losses to grapefruit crop; bacteria survive in lesions; the main method of spread is via wind driven rain; bacteria may enter through pruning wounds.
Management If the disease is introduced to an area, all infected trees should be removed and destroyed; in areas where disease is endemic, windbreaks can help to reduce disease severity; cultural control of the disease should focus on controlling leaf miner populations, utilizing wind breaks and applications of copper sprays.

A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of â€œhuang long bingâ€​, which translates to â€œyellow dragon diseaseâ€​, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees.By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively.
The disease has been known by various names in different countries - â€œgreeningâ€​ in South Africa, â€œmottle leafâ€​ in the Philippines, â€œdiebackâ€​ in India and â€œvein phloem degenerationâ€​ in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant.The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter.It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L.
africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L.asiaticus , found in .A third species, L.americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements.As this species is found in the same areas as L.asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements.Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting.The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar.Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew.
Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed.They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers.When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days.In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur.It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments.
Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956.The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured.Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest.Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus.
Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified.In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms.(ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays.Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T.eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk.In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease.Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.

Cause Insect Comments Aphids transmit tristeza virus on citrus. Management Aphid numbers tend to naturally decline as leaves harden off but can be a problem on young trees or varieties which continually produce flushes of new growth; pesticides are not generally recommended due to resistance and trees can withstand a high degree of leaf curling.Citrus leaf miner Phyllocnistis citrella Adult citrus leafminer moth Citrus leafminer damaged leaves Citrus leafminer larvae Citrus leafminer infected leaves Symptoms Thin, winding trails on leaves; heavy infestation can result in curled and distorted leaves; adult leafminer is a tiny moth which lays its eggs in the leaf; larvae hatch and feed on leaf interior.Cause Insect Comments Leaf miners attack flushes of young growth and are unable to enter leaves once they harden.
Management Insecticide application are rarely warranted in mature orchards as yields are unaffected; young trees should be treated with appropriate insecticides to prevent retarded growth; cultural control methods include removal of water sprouts from trees and refraining from pruning live branches more than once a year to encourage uniform growth flushes which are short in duration.

The tree produces creamy white or pink-red flowers on racemes of 100â€“300 flowers and a rounded fleshy fruit up to 27 mm (1 in) in diameter. The flesh covers a single spherical or elliptical seed (nut) with a white or gray kernel depending on the variety of tree.Macadamia can reach a height of 20 m (65.6 ft) and have a commercial lifespan of 40â€“60 years.Macadamia may also be referred to as Queensland nut or Australian nut and originates from Australia.Macadamia tree and fruit Macadamia leaf close-up Macadamia blossoms Macadamia fruits Macadamia blossoms Macadamia tree Macadamia Content Macadamia with fruits Macadamia trees Uses The kernels of the macadamia nut are mainly consumed as a snack food.The kernels from M.integrifolia and M.tetraphylla can be eaten raw from the shell while the remaining Macadamia species contain toxins which must be removed prior to consumption.Macadamia may also be used in baked goods and confectionery.
Propagation Basic requirements Macadamia trees originate from the sub-tropical rainforests of Australia and therefore tend to grow best in areas of high humidity and high rainfall. They will grow optimally at average annual temperatures between 20 and 25Â°C (68â€“77Â°F) in a deep, well draining loam and sandy loam with a pH between 5.0 and 5.5.Trees should not be planted in heavy clays.It is recommended that macadamia only be planted in frost free areas, young trees will be killed by temperatures of -6Â°C (21Â°F) although older, established trees can tolerate some light frost.Transplanting When planting numerous macadamia trees in a plantation, consideration must be given to drainage, irrigation, row alignment and wind protection.Planting distances tend to be site specific and are dependent on factors such as the macadamia variety, soil and rainfall.In general, macadamia trees are planted 4 to 8 m (13-26 ft) apart within a row, allowing 7 to 11 m (23-36 ft) between rows.
Young trees are planted in Spring and Fall by digging holes which are 45 cm deep and 60 cm in diameter. Once the tree is in position, the hole is backfilled with soil.it is recommended that some compost and rock phosphate be added to the backfill at time of planting.The soil around the tree should then be gently tamped and the tree watered.Staking will help to protect the young trees from wind damage.Grafted trees usually begin to produce fruit 3 years after planting.General care and maintenance During the first four years after planting, animal manure and a thick layer of organic mulch can be applied around the trees year round.after this period, the amount of manure added should be decreased to prevent the trees being provided with too much nitrogen and being deficient in potassium.In the first 4 years following planting, vegetative growth should be stimulated through pruning.
Once the leading shoot has reached a height of approximately 80 cm (31.5 in) it should be clipped to stimulate branching. Established trees are usually pruned in the Spring when old, unproductive and diseased branches are removed from the canopy.Any nuts remaining on the tree should also be removed.Mulches are best applied after nut harvest to allow the material to decompose before the next crop.Avoid piling mulch up against the trunks to prevent disease.Harvesting Grafted trees will begin to produce a crop 3 years after planting but it is not until the 7th year that the crop will be of any economic significance.Trees will give maximum yields 15 to 20 years after planting.Nuts should be collected when they fall from the tree and this should be done every 1-2 weeks during the nut producing periods.In commercial plantations, nuts can be collected mechanically or by hand.References Augstburger, F., Berger, J., Censkowsky, U., Heid, P., Milz, J.& Streit, C.(2000).Macadamia nuts.

Generally, mandarin trees are small and spiny with long, slender branches. They can have an erect or drooping growth habit depending on variety.The leaves of the trees are lanceolate and may be hairless or toothed with narrowly winged petioles.The trees produce flowers singly or in clusters and globose fruits with a bright orange to red-orange peel and segmented orange flesh.Mature mandarin trees can reach 7â€“8 m 23â€“26 ft in height and can be very long lived if they do not succumb to disease.Mandarins originate from Southeast Asia.Tangerines ripening on the branch Uses Mandarin oranges are commonly eaten fresh or may be processed for canned segments.They can be pressed or squeezed to produce juice which is used in many beverages.Mandarin essential oil is used as a flavoring in alcoholic drinks.Propagation Mandarin oranges Content Propagation Requirements Mandarin oranges are subtropical plants and the trees grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season.
They will grow best at temperatures between 12.8 and 37.8Â°C (55â€“100Â°F) during the growing season and 1.7 to 10Â°C (35â€“50Â°F) during dormancy. Mature mandarin orange trees can survive short periods of freezing, whereas young trees will be killed.Fruit will also be damaged by freezing conditions.The trees will tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil.Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development.Mandarin orange trees require full sun and should be protected from wind.Mandarin oranges propagation Mandarin orange seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock as seeds will not produce fruit true to type.Grafting is the process by which a scion from plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree.
Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud. Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well.Common rootstocks for grafting and budding of citrus trees include sour orange and rough lemon.Budding Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6â€“9 mm/0.25â€“0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant).Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden.The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined.It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees.
The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees. The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves.These budsticks can be stored for 2â€“3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding.The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground.Using a sharp knife, a 2.5â€“3.8 cm (1â€“1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark.A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a â€œT-shapeâ€​ The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark.
Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9â€“2.5 cm(0.75â€“1.0 in) in length.Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant.Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.After the union has formed and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem 2.5â€“3.9 cm (1.0â€“1.5 in) above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem on the same side as the join.The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground.This process, known as â€œloppingâ€​ allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in length, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.
Planting seedlings Mandarin orange trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area.Standard sized trees should be spaced 3.7â€“7.6 m (12â€“25 ft) apart in an area that receives full sunlight, but is protected from strong winds which can damage the trees.Planting against a south facing wall will help protect the tree in cooler climates.General care Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established.During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil.Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3â€“7 days.The soil should be moist, but not wet.Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently.
Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.

Family: Anacardiaceae. Genus: Mangifera.Species: M.indica.Local names: Swahili (mwembe) Origin Mango (mangiferia indica) is one of the most cultivated fruits that originated between northwest Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northwestern India.Numerous cultivars have been developed and spread all over the world including Kenya where it is cultivated in different parts of the country but primarily produced in Ukambani.Mango Content General information about the crop Mango is an evergreen tree in the Anacardiaceae family that is grown for its edible fruit.It has a dark, glossy, elliptical, or lanceolate leaf with long petioles and a leathery texture.It produces dense clusters of flowers with cream-pink petals.Mango fruit is roughly oval in shape, with uneven sides.The fruit is a drupe, with an outer flesh surrounding a stone.The flesh is soft and yellow-orange in color.The fruit's skin ranges from yellow-green to red.
Mango trees can reach a height of 45 meters (148 feet) and live for more than a century. Mango is thought to have originated in India or Burma (Myanmar).Mangoes are produced in most parts of Africa including Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, and Ivory Coast.In Kenya, it is produced in Garissa, Kitui, Murang'a, Elgeyo Marakwet, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Garissa, Makueni, Taita Taveta, Tharaka Nithi, Embu but Ukambani leads in production.The mango tree is always green and its fruits varied in size, some are round, and some are oval, slender, long, kidney- shaped, and heart-shaped.Some of the varieties of mangoes are either colored with a shade of red and others yellow while others are green.Apple mango, Kent mango, Tommy mango, and Ngowe mango are Kenyan mango varieties.Mango fruit is not only sweet but also has nutritional value as it helps improve immunity and plays an important role in digestion.
Mango fruit is low in calories and is the best choice when reducing calorie intake. Mangoes have mostly consumed as a fruit known as mangoes which are highly rich in vitamins A, C, and D.Mango varieties The first variety of mangoes was seen in India over 4000 years ago and then spread all over the world.Mango is now consumed all over the world more than any other fruit.Â Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known for different shapes, colors, lengths, and sizes.Green and yellow mangoes are the most common varieties in Kenya.Polyembryonic cultivars are generated from seed obtained from a tree plant.It includes local cultivars such as "Dodo", "Ngowe", "Boribo", "Sabre", "Peach", and "Batawi".Cultivar seeds can produce up to five nucellar embryos that are genetically identical to the parent tree.Plants like "Tommy Atkins," "Kent," "Haden," and "Van Dyke" can only be propagated vegetatively.
There are numerous advantages to vegetative propagation, such as early bearing, smaller trees, and so on. It should be encouraged as a result of this.Planting and propagation Mango can be propagated either vegetatively or by seed.Its important for farmers to know that not all cultivars propagated by seed will produce seedlings that are same to their parent tree.Plant propagation has got two distinct groups: -Polyembroic cultivars.-Husbandry.It is best to use fresh, healthy mango seeds from mature, well-grown trees.They need to be washed and dried in the shade for a few days before being planted.Â Sow them at a 15 x 30 cm spacing and 5 cm depth.Place them on their sides, with the most prominently curved edge facing up, to form a straight stem.To hasten germination, the hard husk can be removed before sowing.Seedlings are best grown in a half-shade nursery.
Seeds germinate in 1 to 2 weeks and are transplanted into containers as soon as the first flush of growth hardens (about 4 weeks later and about 10 cm high) (about 18 x 24 cm). When they reach pencil-thickness, which is approximately 20 cm above soil level, they are ready for grafting.Cleft graft with improved cultivar scion.Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) (Mtwapa, Thika, Embu), prison farms, or any farm with the desired cultivars are good sources of scions of improved cultivars.Water frequently and shade the grafted plants.At about 4 months after grafting, grafted seedlings will be ready for transplanting.Choose the location of the orchard with care.It is recommended that the soil be deeply cultivated by ploughing.All trees, bushes, and weeds are to be removed from the field before transplanting.Transplanting is ideal during the start of the rainy season.The planting hole should be 60 x 60 cm in size and 100 cm in depth.
The hole should be larger (about 90 mm) in dry condition. Depending on the variety and growth habit of the mango variety chosen, the spacing between trees ranges from 9 x 9 to 14 x 14 m.Before returning the soil to the hole with the young plant, mix in at least two buckets of good compost and a handful of Mijingu rock phosphate before returning the soil to the hole with the young mango plant.Consolidate the soil around the plant.Mulch and waterÂ thoroughly.Irrigation should be limited to the first year of the young trees.Climatic conditions, soils, and water For it to grow it requires a loamy, alluvial, well-drained, aerated, and deep soil which is well drained to hold its extensive roots.When the tree is growing irrigation is highly encouraged to widen its scope for intercropping.Â Irrigation is stopped when the tree is big to produce fruits.
The correct temperature for growing mangoes is 24c-30c during the growing period with rainfall of 890-1,015 mm is considered ideal for mango growing. Husbandry In the area directly beneath the tree canopy, weeds should be kept to a minimum.During the first five years, intercropping with annual crops is recommended to maximize income until an economical mango yield is achieved.In young plantations, mulching around the tree helps to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.Pruning is an essential practice for mango trees; it helps in shaping young trees.Apart from controlling pests, pruning mango trees promotes flowering.Formative pruning is done on young trees during their first years to help them grow into the desired shape.In the first year, cap the seedling at 1 m in height to produce a spreading framework of branches.In the second year, prune to leave 4 to 5 well-spaced branches as future main branches.
Advantages of pruning: Advantages of pruning: -It enables the tree to produce fruits on its tree's outer parts, which helps the fruit to mature on the trees. -The open tree structure facilitates harvesting.-It enables the tree to produce larger fruits.-Allows other crops to be grown in the shade of trees.The tree benefits from the natural conditions of sun and wind movement.This reduces relative humidity within the canopy while also creating a less conducive environment for disease development.Following fruit harvest, structural pruning should be performed, with the canopy at least one meter above the ground.Remove any dead or sucker branches that have grown from the main structural branches, and prune the canopy to allow sunlight to pass through the canopy and reach the ground beneath the tree.Harvesting.Flowering usually begins after a dormant period caused by cool or dry weather.Smoke is commonly used by smallholder mango farmers to induce flowering.
A mango plantation will begin producing commercially marketable fruit fromÂ four to five years after planting and will be in good production after eight years, reaching full maturity at around 20 years of age. A single tree should produce 200 to 500 fruits per year, with some varieties, such as "Dodo" and "Boribo," producing up to 1000 fruits per year.Most varieties produce biennially, and a poor harvest may follow a good one.Varieties with an annual bearing tendency should be selected.Harvest mango fruit when it has reached the mature-green stage when it is hard and green.The "cheeks" of mature fruit are well-developed.Fruit should be picked by hand.Clip them off with a long stalk of about 2 to 3 cm and pack the fruit in a single layer in the box or crate with the stalks facing downwards.The latex that drips from the stalk must fall onto an absorbent material (for example tissue paper placed at the bottom of the container).
Although mature mangoes ripen quickly, they have a low tolerance for temperatures below 10Â°C, especially when picked fresh. Ripe fruits, on the other hand, can be stored at temperatures as low as 7 to 8Â° C without developing a chilling injury.Products Apart from the Mango tree cultivated to produce fruits, it can also be as fodder where its leaves can be used to feed cattle in small quantities.Its wood can be used to generate charcoal and firewood and as a honey plant.A mango tree can also produce timber for construction and carpentry.Mangoes can also be poisonous to sensitive individuals and their sleeves and seeds can be used as medicine to treat coughs, colds, and styptic.Services Mango trees provide various services to the soil, human beings, and animals.For example, it grows into an umbrella- shaped crown which provides shade and shelter for both animals and human beings.Also, when the leaves are used in mulching it improves soil fertility.
A mango tree can also be intercropped with other plants and fruits to create a home garden.

The infected inflorescences may dry up affecting the fruit set and may cause fruit drop.Severely infected plants may show wilting and thereby affect fruit setting.Cause Insect Comments a.Mealybugs lay eggs in soil near tree trunk.b.The mealybugs secrete the honey dew which causes sooty mold.c.It feeds on wide range of plant species.Management 1.
Collect and burn fallen leaves and twigs. 2.Flooding orchard with water during October kills egg present in soil.Also deep ploughing in November exposes egg to sunlight.3.After hatching the nymphs start climbing tree and suck sap.To avoid this band the tree trunks with polythene sheet (400 gauge, 30 cm wide) at a height of about 30 cm from the ground level and apply grease at the lower edge of band.Or you can use Funnel Type Slippery Traps.4.To control insects already on tree you can spray fish oil rosin soap or azadirachtin (neem products).5.Also soil application of the spores of the fungus, Beauveria bassiana helps in reducing mealybug population.6.If infestation is severe you can spray suitable insecticides Mango tree borer Batocera rufomaculata Adult mango tree borer (2) Adult mango tree borer About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us Symptoms Mango tree borer damage may first be noticed as circular holes in the bark.
This damage indicates that the tree has been attacked by borers which have chewed exit holes in the wood. Mango tree borers feed on the bark of twigs and chew green growing tips; when feeding damage is severes, branches may be killed and the main stem of the tree may collapse; insect frass (feces) collects in cracks in the bark and around the base of the tree; holes become visible in the bark.Cause Insect Comments Mango tree borers are a pest of mango trees in many parts of Asia, Africa, Central America, the Caribbean and the Solomon Islands; female tree borers lay their eggs in an incision made in damaged mango bark; larvae bore through the wood as they feed and eventually pupate within the tree; adult insects emerge from an exit hole that they cut in the wood.
adult insects are 25â€“55 mm long with distinctive long antennae which extend the length of the body Management Application of appropriate insecticide to the trunk and branches of the tree when adult insects are present acts to kill any eggs and larvae that are present; insecticide applied to growing twigs and green shoots may deter adult feeding; probing injury sites with a knife or piece of wire can help to destroy larvae and eggs White Mango Scale Aulacaspis tubercularis Mango scale Scale infestation on mango leaves (also occurrence of sooty mold due to scale infestation) Female and male scale insects Symptoms Scale insects suck the sap from leaves, branches and fruits which causes defoliation, drying up of young twigs, poor blossoming and also affect the quality of fruits by causing conspicuous pink blemishes. Infestation of young plants results in retard growth.In case of severe infestation the fruits may fall prematurely, whereas the mature fruits are reduced in size.
Another major problem with scale insect is the development of sooty mold due to honeydew secretion. Cause Insect Comments The insect have wide host range and can be seen in all mango growing countries like Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Italy and in many South American countries.Management Remove the infested plant parts and burn them.Spraying emulsive oil or suitable insecticides at recommended quantity will helps in reducing scale population.

Marjoram plants can be woody or herbaceous and possess multiple branching stems.The leaves are oval or round and are arranged alternately on the stems.The plants produce small pink, purple or white flowers and small oval, brown fruits and can reach up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in height.Marjoram is perennial and can be grown for 3â€“4 years but is commonly grown as an annual in northern climates.
Marjoram may also be referred to as sweet marjoram and originated from the eastern part of the Mediterranean in Cyprus and southern Turkey. Marjoram plant Marjoram flowers Marjoram plant Uses The leaves of the marjoram plant are used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking.They may also be dried and used to extract essential oil which is used as a flavoring.Marjoram Content Propagation Basic requirements Marjoram is a temperate or subtropical plant and should be grown in full sunlight for best results.Marjoram will thrive in dry, rocky conditions which closely mimic their natural habitat.Plants will grow well in a rich, light loam with a pH range between 4.9â€“8.7.The optimum pH for marjoram is around 6.9.Marjoram is less hardy than its relative oregano and will grow best when the annual temperature does not fall below 15Â°C.Propagation Marjoram can be propagated from seed, cuttings, layering or by dividing the root.
The optimum method of vegetative propagation depends on the size and growth habit of the mother plant. Seeds Seeds should be sown outdoors when the soil has warmed and all danger of frost has passed.Seeds can also be started indoors to produce transplants.Marjoram seeds should be sown indoors 6â€“8 weeks before planting outside.Sow seeds in a sterile seed starting mix in seed trays or pots 0.2â€“1.0 cm (0.08â€“0.4 in) deep and water gently.Ensure the temperature remains between 15.5 and 27Â°C (60â€“80Â°F).Seeds should germinate in about 5 days at 21Â°C (70Â°F).Due to the slow growing nature of the plant, many home growers choose to start with small plants which can be obtained from a nursery or garden center.Layering Sprawling marjoram varieties are easily layered by selecting a branch and covering with soil.A rock can be placed on top to hold the branch securely under the soil.
The branch will develop itâ€™s own root system and once established, can be cut from the mother plant and transplanted to a new site. Cuttings Larger, upright plants lend themselves to propagating from cuttings.Cuttings should be taken from approximately 20 cm (8 in) down the stem so that the basal portion of the cutting is hard and woody.The upper 5 cm (2 in) of the cutting can be nipped off to promote branching.Cuttings can be rooted in water, sand or a mixture of sand, peat and perlite.Transplanting Marjoram seedlings can be transplanted to the garden when they are between 6 and 8 weeks old, about 2 weeks after the last frost date.Plants should be spaced approximately 30 cm (12 in) apart, allowing 45 cm (18 in) between rows.Pinching back the growing tip of the plants after transplanting will encourage the growth of new shoots.Marjoram requires more moisture than oregano and soil moisture can be conserved by applying a layer of mulch around the plants.
General care and maintenance Established marjoram plants are tolerant of drought but cannot tolerate water-logging. Established plants require additional irrigation only in very dry conditions.Marjoram planted outdoors requires minimum fertilization, particularly if planted in sandy or gravelly soils.In contrast, container grown plants require frequent addition of fertilizer.A half strength balanced fertilizer can be applied every two weeks if required.Marjoram plants should be pruned regularly to stimulate new growth.this pruning can simply be a method of harvesting from the plant but in the winter, any dead or damaged wood should be removed from the plant Harvesting Marjoram leaves can begin to be harvested any time after the plants have reached a height of 15â€“20 cm (6â€“8 in).Harvest leaves by pinching the leaves from the tips of the stems to encourage the more branching.Leaves should be pinched regularly to keep the plants productive and prevent them from going to seed.
the best time to harvest marjoram leaves is just prior to flowering. Waiting or buds to form before harvesting will ensure the maximum essential oil content in the leaves.References Savio, Y & Robinson C.(1998).Marjoram, sweet marjoram, knot marjoram.In: Speciality and Minor Crop Handbook.University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources.Available at: http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/sustainag/extn_pub/veggie%20pubs/Marjaram,%20Sweet%20Marjaram,%20Knot%20M arjoram.pdf.[Accessed 18 February 15].Free to access .Meyers, M.(2005).Oregano and marjoram.The Herb Society of America.Available at: http://www.herbsociety.org/factsheets/Oregano%20and%20Majoram.pdf.[Accessed 18 February 15].Free to access .

Mint plants are mainly aromatic perennials and they possess erect, branching stems and oblong to ovate or lanceolate leaves arranged in opposing pairs on the stems. The leaves are often covered in tiny hairs and have a serrated margin.Mint plants produce a terminal flower spike and the flowers can be white or purple in color depending on variety.Mint plants are fast growing and can become very invasive.They can reach heights of 60â€“90 cm and will cpntinue to grow for many years once established.Mint may also be referred to by species and these include, but are not limited to peppermint, spearmint, water mint and Japanese mint.Peppermint flowers Chocolate mint Mint plant Uses Mint leaves are used fresh or dried to make teas, jams and desserts.Essentila oil can be extracted from the leaves and is used as a flavoring.Mint Content Propagation Basic requirements Mint is a rapidly growing plant which is very easy to grow.
It is best grown in partial shade to full sun and is generally very hardy, tolerating temperatures down to -29Â°C (-20Â°F). Care should be taken with variegated varieties which may scorch in full sun.Mint is very fast growing which can lead to it invading gardens quickly unless controlled.The best soils for planting mint are rich and moist with a slightly acidic pH between 6.0 and 7.0.Propagation Mint is readily propagated from seeds, cuttings or by dividing an established plant.Seeds should be planted in the Spring or in the Fall in areas that are free from frost.Seeds should be sown to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in).Seedling should be thinned after emergence such that the plants are spaced 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in) apart.Established mint can be easily divided for transplanting by taking some branches along with a portion of root.Many people choose to keep mint in containers or sink the containers into the ground when planting to prevent mint from spreading uncontrollably.
General care and maintenance Mint is very vigorous and should be pruned regularly to keep the plants in check. Remove any unwanted runners and pinch the tips of the plants back regularly.Mint may be fertilized in the Spring with a slow release fertilizer to supply it with nutrients throughout the growing season.Pinch of any flowers that form to conserve the flavor of the leaves.Essential oil content is reduced during bloom.In areas with mild winters, mint can be moved to a sheltered area of the garden to overwinter, otherwise the plant can be cut to the ground in the Fall.Container grown mint plants can be brought indoors.Harvest Mint leaves can be harvested as soon as the plants have reached 8 to 10 cm (3-4 in) in height.Cut leaves and stems with a sharp knife or scissors.If harvesting whole stems, cut the stem at about 2.5 cm (1 in) from the soil line.References Buckland, K.& Drost, D.(2009).MInt in the garden.Utah State Cooperative Extension.

The genus includes white mulberry ( Morus alba ) and red mulberry ( Morus rubra ). Mulberries are small to medium sized shrubs or trees with a thick tan-gray ridged trunk and light green leaves which vary in shape depending on variety.Leaves are arranged alternately and are lobed or unlobed, cordate (heart-shaped), dentate (toothed) and acuminate (tapering).The trees produce small green-yellow flowers in dense spikes and an oval aggregate fruit made up of individual drupelets.The fruit can be white, pink or purple to purple-black in color and contains numerous brown seeds.Mulberry can reach a height of 15 m (49 ft) and are quite short lived, with an economic lifespan of around 15 years.Mulberry is believed to originate from China.Unripe fruits Red mulberry Ripening fruit Unripe fruits White mulberry tree Female inflorescence Red mulberry leaves Male inflorescence Mulberries Mulberry Content Uses Mulberries can be eaten fresh or used as fillings for tarts and pies.
The fruit may also be used to make jams and jellies. They have been traditionally planted as a food source for silk worms.Propagation Basic requirements Mulberry trees should be grown in sunny locations, preferably in a deep soil.Mulberries are reasonably tolerant of drought, particularly white mulberry and can be grown successfully in poor soil.Mulberry will grow well in a variety of soils but optimum growth will be achieved when planted in a deep well draining loam with a slightly acidic pH of between 5.5 and 6.5.Fruit yields are increased when trees are positioned in full sun.Mulberry trees are cold hardy, although the specific temperature at which they will be damaged varies by variety.Some white mulberries can withstand temperatures of -32Â°C (-25Â°F).Propagation Mulberry trees can be propagated from seeds, cuttings or by grafting.Seeds should be collected from ripe fruits and removed by macerating the fruit in a water bath.
Seeds which sink to the bottom of the bath are viable and can be planted immediately or dried and cold stored for planting later. Trees grown from seed can take 10 years or more to produce fruit.Cuttings can be taken during regular pruning of the tree.Branches should be 22 to 30 cm (8.6â€“11.8 in) in length and possess a minimum of three buds.Cuttings should be planted immediately.Grafted plants produce stronger root systems than trees produced by any other method of propagation.Grafting is usually achieved by budding in the Spring.Planting In the case of mulberry bushes, seedling are transplanted when they have reached 10â€“15 cm (4â€“6 in) in height.Seedlings for mulberry trees should be allowed to grow larger, usually at least 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and are trained prior to planting.Mulberry trees do not need to cross pollinate but if growing more than one tree they should be spaced 1.6 m (5.2 ft) apart.
General care and maintenance Although established trees are relatively tolerant of drought, mulberries should be provided with additional irrigation during dry periods. The trees require little fertilization and a single annual application of a balanced fertilizer is usually sufficient to meet the growing requirement of the trees.Once trained, little pruning of the trees is required.Dead and damaged wood should be removed at the end of the growing season.Harvesting Mulberry fruit is usually ready for harvest in late Spring.The fruits are usually harvested by hand either by picking them from the tree directly, or by shaking the branches.References Duke, J.A.(1983) Handbook of Energy Crops.unpublished.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/morus_alba.html#Cultivation.[Accessed 23 February 15].Free to access .

Mushrooms are highly variable in appearance depending on their stage of development and variety. Agaricus mushrooms have a cap and stem, the cap is a pale grey or brown in color and is rounder while immature, but flattens out as it reaches maturity and can reach a diameter of 5â€“10 cm (2â€“4 in).Pleurotus mushrooms may not have a stem and instead may be laterally attached to a growing substrate such as the bark of a a tree.Pleurotus mushrooms are smooth and elongated and can reach 4â€“15 cm (1.5â€“6.0 in) in diameter.Volvariella mushrooms are small, with pink gills and a characteristic sac-like covering (volva) at the base of the stem.The cap can reach 5â€“15 cm (2â€“6 in) in diameter.Harvested Agaricus mushrooms Wild growing oyster mushrooms Oyster mushroom cultivation Straw mushrooms Agaricus mushrooms Agaricus mushrooms Uses Mushrooms are widely used after cooking and are incorporated into many dishes worldwide.
Mushrooms Content Propagation Basic requirements Mushrooms grow from a filamentous mass (mycelia or 'spawn') that grows on dead or decaying plant material. Agaricus mushrooms can be cultivated in a dark, moist, cool space such as a basement.Agaricus mushrooms require a rich organic material in which to grow such as horse manure.Oyster mushrooms are cultivated on hardwood logs by introducing spawn into pre-drilled holes in the wood or or by sawing a section through the log and covering the exposed wood in spawn before nailing the log back together.The logs are then stored in watertight bags containing sand and soaked with water.Oyster mushrooms can also be grown in straw or sawdust by inoculating the sterile substrate with spawn and sealing in plastic bags.Straw mushrooms can be grown on wheat straw, rice straw or sawdust inoculated with spawn and stored at temperatures between 28 and 36Â°C and relative humidity of 75â€“85%.
Propagating Agaricus mushrooms Substrate Substrates for growing Agaricus mushrooms are either agricultural by- products such as straw bedded horse manure or synthetic composts specially formulated for mushroom growing. Horse manure substrates should have a nitrogen content of 1.5â€“1.7%, while synthetic composts should contain between 1.7 and 1.9%.Additional nitrogen can be added to the substrate if required using nitrogen supplements or through the addition of poultry manure.Gypsum is commonly added to the mix to buffer the pH and to give the compost the desired structure for optimum mushroom growth.The growing substrate then must be composted to make it suitable for growing mushrooms.Horse manure is composted by turning every 4â€“5 days and watering after each turning to keep the substrate moist.The compost is ready to use when it turns a rich brown color, usually after 4 or 5 turnings.Other compost mixes should be turned after 5â€“6 days and kept moist by watering.
The compost should be turned a second time and should be ready for use after another week. the compost is then set out in trays for planting the spawn.In commercial mushroom production, the compost is pasteurized to remove and fungal, bacterial or insect contaminants from the medium before the spawn is planted.Spawn Mushroom spawn can be purchased from many commercial seed companies or online suppliers.Spawn should be planted when the compost reaches 24Â°C (75Â°F) and should be planted in the trays at a depth of 5 cm (2 in) allowing 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) between plantings.The temperature should be kept at 21Â°C (70Â°F) for the next 21 days before lowering to 15.6Â°C (60Â°F) and covering with a 2.5 cm (1 in) layer of good quality soil.The growing mushrooms should be kept moist throughout by watering with a gentle spray of water whenever the top of the soil begins to dry.
Tiny white spots should begin to appear on the soil surface after approximately 3 weeks and will begin to be ready for harvest approximately 10 days later. Harvesting Harvest the mushrooms at soil level by carefully twisting them or by cutting them at soil level with sharp knife.Pulling can damage other surrounding mushrooms.Harvest flushes of mushrooms daily.The beds will continue to produce for up to 6 months.References Beyer, D.M.(2003).Basic procedures for Agaricus mushroom growing.Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences.Agricultural Research and Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/ul210.pdf.[Accessed 24 February 15].Free to access .

Mustard plants are thin herbaceous herbs with yellow flowers. The leaves of the plant are toothed, lobed, and occasionally have the larger terminal lobes.Plants can reach 16 cm (6.3 in) in length.The yellow flowers grow in spike like clusters of 2â€“12 flowers and individual flowers are 8 mm (0.3 in) in diameter.The seeds are red to brown in color and produced from each flower.Mustard can grow 1.2-2 m (4â€“6.6 ft) in height and as an annual plant, survives only one growing season.Mustard may also be referred to as mustard, brown mustard, red mustard, yellow mustard or wedlock and is believed to have originated in the temperate regions of Europe.Mustard field Mustard field Mustard flowers Uses The leaves and shoots of the mustard plant are consumed as a vegetable in some countries.Mustard seed is incorporated into seasonings and dressings.Mustard may be grown as a cover crop in rotation with other vegetables.
Mustard Content Propagation Basic requirements Mustard grows very well in cool climates with short growing seasons, at temperatures as low as 4.4Â°C (40Â°F). Seedlings can tolerate some light frost but severe frost will kill the plants.The mustard plant can be grown in sandy, loamy or clay soils with a pH between 4.9 and 8.2 and prefers moist soil.The plant will tolerate partial shade.Propagation Mustards is propagated from seed and due to the small size of the seeds, should be planted in a well prepared seed bed which is firm and flat.Mustard seeds should be sown in Spring once soils have warmed to 4.4â€“7.2Â°C (40â€“45Â°F) and should be planted at a depth of 1.25â€“2.5 cm (0.5â€“1.0 in) at a density of 8â€“14 lbs of seeds per acre.The seed can be spread by broadcasting in the home garden or, in the case of commercial production, using a seed drill.Mustard generally matures in 80â€“85 days.
General care and maintenance Weeds can cause huge losses in mustard cultivation as they quickly out compete seedlings and are difficult to eradicate once established. The best method of preventing weed growth in a mustard field is to plant seeds at the appropriate depth.Shallow planted seeds germinate rapidly, allowing the development of a uniform plant stand.Established plants are less susceptible to competition from weeds.soil should be tested to determine nutrient requirements prior to planting.Mustard will benefit from the addition of supplemental nitrogen and this is generally applied at a rate of 100â€“120 lb per acre.Harvesting Mustard is generally ready to harvest 80 to 85 days after planting.The crop should be harvested promptly to reduce losses to shattering.In commercially grown fields the recommended method of harvest is swathing.The plants should be cut just below the height of the lowest seed pods.
In the home garden, mustard can be harvested by hand by cutting the plants. The seeds can then be recovered from the pods and dried for storage.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Brassica nigra (black mustard)datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10097.[Accessed 25 February 15].Paid subscription required .Oplinger, E.S., Oelke, E.A., Putnam, D.H., Kelling, K.A., Kaminsid, A.R., Teynor, T.M., Doll, J.D.& Durgan, B.R.(1991).Mustard.In: Alternative Field Crops Manual.University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/afcm/mustard.html.[Accessed 25 February 15].Free to access .Snapp, S., Date, K., Cichy, K.& Oâ€™Neil, K.(2006).Mustards â€“ a Brassica cover crop for Michigan.Michigan State University, Department of Crop and Soil Sciences.Available at: http://forage.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/E2956- Mustards-BrassicaCoverCrop-Snapp-etal-20061.pdf.[Accessed 25 February 15].Free to access .

The nutmeg tree has natural conical shape with a grey-brown trunk and dark green glossy leaves.The branches of the tree spread in whorls and the leaves are oval or lanceolate in shape.Leaves are arranged alternately on the branches and are 5â€“15 cm (2â€“6 in) in length, smooth and lighter in color on the under side.The tree produces a clusters of numerous male flowers whereas the female flowers are produced solitary or in a maximum cluster of 3.The flowers are pale yellow and fragrant.The fruit of the nutmeg tree is a rounded fleshy berry which splits into two halves when it ripens.The seed inside is shiny dark brown and oval in shape.
The seed coat is covered by lacy red aril which is attached at the base of the seed. Nutmeg trees can reach a height of 20 m (66 ft) and may live for upwards of 80 years.Nutmeg may also be referred to as mace and it is not known in a wild state.It likely originated from the Moluccan Islands, particularly the volcanic island of Banda.Nutmeg fruits on the tree Nutmeg fruit Uses The seed of the nutmeg berry (nutmeg) and the aril (mace) are dried and used whole or ground as culinary spices.Nutmeg Content Propagation Basic requirements Nutmeg is a tropical plant and requires dry periods to flower.It will grow best at temperatures between 20 and 30Â°C (68â€“86Â°F) and can tolerate a range of soils provided that the are well draining.Trees will grow optimally in a deep loamy sand rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.The trees love heat but should be protected from strong afternoon sun and also require some shelter from wind.
Propagation Seeds Trees grown from seed do not flower until they are between 6 and 8 years old and sex cannot be determined until this time. For this reason, 2â€“3 seedlings are planted in one place in commercial production and excess male trees are removed or replanted when they can be identified as they will not produce fruit.Seeds should be planted immediately harvest.They should not be allowed to dry out prior to planting.Seeds are commonly planted 6 Ã— 6 m (20 Ã— 20 ft) apart and thinned when required.A spacing of 10 Ã— 10 m (33 Ã— 33 ft) is desirable for fully grown trees.In the home garden a male and female tree are required for fruit production and they should be spaced at least 10 m (33 ft) apart.The tree will reach full size after about 20 years.Marcotting Nutmeg trees can also be grown from marcotted material.Vigorous branches are selected from female trees.The branches should be 1.2â€“1.5 cm in diameter.
The branch is then split longitudinally in an area that is approximately 90 cm (35 in) from the end of the branch. Each split should be approximately 5 cm (2 in) in length.A bamboo splint is positioned along the area of the split to secure the branch and prevent it from breaking.A small piece of the split branch is then removed on the bottom side of the branch.This piece is approximately 6â€“12 mm (02â€“0.4 in) long.The remainder of the split is held open by placing a piece of hardwood to act as a wedge.Finally, the exposed piece of branch is dusted with rooting powder and wrapped in moistened peat moss, coconut coir or similar and sealed in polyethylene sheeting.Marcotted branches usually develop roots in 4â€“12 months.once an adequate root system has developed, the branches are severed from the tree and potted.Planting Nutmeg trees should be planted in an area with adequate shade to protect the young trees while they establish.
Shading is commonly achieved by intercropping with other crops such as cocoa or banana. Marcots are planted in holes which are approximately 60 Ã— 60 cm (24 Ã— 24 in).Composted manure is worked into the soil and the trees are set in the holes.Stakes are used to protect the newly planted trees.Harvesting Fruits are harvested when they are open by using a blade attached to the end of a long pole.A basket is also attached to the end of the pole such that when the fruit is cut from the tree with the blade, it drops into the basket.Seeds may also be collected from the ground after they have dropped from the tree but this encourages crop losses through disease.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/35361.[Accessed 25 February 15].Paid subscription required .Marcelle, G.B.(1995).Production, handling and processing of nutmeg and mace and their culinary uses.

Several species of oats are grown commercially in different regions of the world, including Avena sativa (common oat), Avena byzantina (Algerian or red oat), Avena nuda (naked oat) and Avena sterilis (the sterile or animated oat). Like wheat, oats generally have been developed into different varieties that are adapted to planting at different times of the year.Spring oats are planted for a late summer harvest, whereas Winter oats are planted for harvesting in early to mid summer.Overwintering varieties are more commonly grown in regions with mild winters.Oats generally possess an upright stem and fibrous root system.The inflorescence consists of a number of branches, or racemes, and spikelets (20â€“150 per plant) which usually contain three florets or flowers (naked oats produce 3â€“7 flowers per spikelet).Generally, two seeds (kernels) are produced per spikelet, but sometimes only one develops.
Ancestors of the common oat, Avena sativa and the closely related Avena byzantina originated from the Fertile Crescent of the Near East. Oats ready for harvest Oat closu-up Oat Field of oats Oats Ripening oats Oats Content Uses Oats can be rolled or crushed to produce oatmeal or ground to produce oat flour.Oats may also be used in the production of several baked goods such as oat cakes or oat bread.The vast majority of commercially grown oats are used as livestock feed.Propagation Basic requirements Oats grow best in cool, moist climates, with the optimum temperature for growth being between 20 and 21Â°C (68â€“70Â°F).The plants will thrive in well drained soils but are adapted to grow in many soil types, requiring a pH between 5.5 and 7.0.Oats are less tolerant of drought and heat than other cereals but, like other small grains, tolerate acidic soils well.
Propagation Oats are propagated from seed which can be sown in Spring or in Fall depending on the variety, prevailing climate and the intended use. Commercially produced oats are drilled into a prepared seedbed.Seedbeds should be firm and free of any weeds or vegetation.If oats are being grown to harvest grain then the recommended seeding rate is 60â€“90 lb of seed per acre.This should be increased slightly if the seeds is being sown by broadcasting as is commonly the case in small-scale production or home gardens.Seeds should be sown at depths of 3â€“7 cm (1.2â€“2.8 in) allowing 15â€“17 cm (5.9â€“6.7 in) between rows.General care and maintenance Soil should be tested prior to planting oats in order to establish the rate of fertilizer and lime application required.Lime is often applied to raise the pH of the soil.if pH is too low, yields may be reduced.Nitrogen should be applied to oats after seedlings emerge at a rate of 20 lb per acre.
Further applications are made throughout the growing season based on the specific soil and rotation schedule. In addition to nitrogen, oats require phosphorus and potassium for optimal growth.The rates of application of these nutrients should be based on the results of a soil test.Harvesting Oats are ready to harvest when the kernels are at the â€œhard doughâ€​ stage when the grain moisture content drops below 14%.The plants will have lost their green color and appear yellow-brown.The kernels harden and cannot be dented with a fingernail.Commercially produced oats are harvested by combine.Small-scale productions can be harvested by hand cutting.After harvest, the grain must be dried before being stored.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Avena sativa (oats) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/8061.[Accessed 26 February 15].Paid subscription required .Mask, P.L., van Reissen, H.W.& Ball, D.(1994).Production guide for oats.

Description Oil palm, includes the palm species native to Africa, Elaeis guineensis , and the species native to South and Central America, Elaeis oleifera . Both species are perennial tropical trees in the family Arecaceae which are grown for their oil which is used in cooking and in industry.Oil palm trees are unbranched with a long stout single stem, or trunk, terminating in a crown of 7â€“100 leaves.The leaves are pinnate and can reach 3â€“5 m (9.8â€“16.4 ft) in length.The tree produces large, spherical red fruits in bunches.Up to 200 fruits can be produced per bunch and and the oil is extracted from the pulp and kernel.Oil palm can reach heights of 20â€“30 m (65.6â€“98.4 ft) and has an economic lifespan of 25â€“30 years, at which point they become too tall to be managed efficiently and are cut down.Left alone, oil palm has been known to live for periods up to 200 years.Oil palm may also be referred to as African oil palm and originated from West Africa.
Oil palm fruit Oil palm plantation, Indonesia Oil palm plantation Harvested oil palm fruits Oil palms Oil palms Oil palm Content Uses Palm oil is widely used as a cooking oil, as an ingredient in many processed foods and as a substitute for butter. Palm oil can be used to produce biodiesel.Palm oil is also used as a binding agent in cosmetics.Propagation Basic requirements Oil palm is typically grown in tropical lowland regions over large areas.The tree requires deep soil and stable high temperatures (30â€“32Â°C/86â€“89.6Â°F for at least 80 days) for optimum productivity.Temperatures below 20Â°C (68Â°F) will severely reduce the growth of both species, while the African oil palm will also suffer a reduction in growth at temperatures above 40Â°C (104Â°F).Palms will grow in a variety of deep tropical soils and will tolerate a pH between 4.0 and 8.0.Oil palms have a requirement for continuous moisture throughout the year.
The trees can tolerate 2â€“3 months of dry conditions but it can affect yields. Propagation Trees are propagated from seed and are germinated prior to planting by moistening them and and placing them in a small box within a polyethylene bag placed in a germinator.Once the seeds have germinated they are allowed to grow further in a pre-nursery (a prepared bed, tray or container with fertile soil).The seedlings are then planted on into a nursery where they will be allowed to grow for a further 6â€“12 months before they are planted in the field.Field seedlings are planted in the field allowing 9 m (29.5 ft) between trees and an additional 9 m (29.5 ft) between rows.Trees will begin to bear fruit after 3â€“4 years.General care and maintenance Oil palms are frequently planted along with a leguminous cover crop which helps provide nitrogen to the palms while also suppressing weeds.When bunches are harvested, it is usual for fronds to be pruned.
The number of fronds per palm is maintained at between 35 and 40. Oil palm plantations are rarely, if ever, irrigated.Due to the moisture requirements of the palms, supplemental irrigation is recommended during dry spells.Harvesting Harvesting of oil palms generally begins 2.5 years after the trees are planted in the field.Harvesting takes place throughout the year, usually at 2â€“3 week intervals, as the bunches ripen.Bunches are harvested by cutting from the tree using a sharp knife or sickle.Oil palm nursery References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Elaeis guineensis (African oil palm) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/20295.[Accessed 26 February 15].Paid subscription required .Elliott, M.L., Broschat, T.K., Uchida, J.Y.& Simone, G.W.(2004).Compendium of Ornamental Palm Disease and Disorders.American Phytopathological Society Press.Available at: http://www.apsnet.org/apsstore/shopapspress/Pages/43143.aspx.Available for purchase from APS Press .

It is a common ingredient in soups and sauces. The pods can be conserved by drying or pickling.The leaves are sometimes used as spinach or cattle feed, the fibers from the stem for cord, the plant mucilage (thick gluey substance) for medical and industrial purposes, and the seeds as a substitute for coffee.Okra seeds contain a considerable amount of good-quality oil and protein.Okra plants have small erect stems that can be bristly or hairless with heart-shaped leaves.The leaves are 10â€“20 cm (4â€“8 in) long with 5â€“7 lobes The plant produces flowers with five white to yellow petals which are 4â€“8 cm (1.6â€“3.1 in) in diameter.The seed pod is a capsule up to 25 cm (10 in) long, containing numerous seeds.Okra can grow 1.2â€“1.8 m (4â€“6 ft) tall and as an annual plant, survives only one growing season.It is believed to have originated in Ethiopia but is also particularly popular in India, West Africa, and Brazil.
Okra Varieties in Kenya Pusa sawani: High-yielding variety tolerant to vein mosaic. It grows 2 to 2.5 m tall and has long pods.(18 to 20 cm), dark green, smooth, and has 5 ridges.Mainly for export.Clemson spineless: 1.2 to 1.5 m tall.Pods are about 15 cm long, green, and moderately ridged.Green Emerald2: This variety is about 1.5 m tall.Pods are 18 to 20 cm long, slightly ridged (rounded), and green.White velvet: A medium-tall variety of 1.5 to 1.8 m high.Pods are 15 to 18 cm long, slender, tapered, smooth, and creamy white.Dwarf Green Long Pod: It grows up to 0.9 m high.It has several side branches.The pods are angular and green and about 18 to 20 cm long.Okra Varieties in India Pusa Makhmali: Variety produces light green fruits.Punjab no.13: Suitable for cultivating in the spring-summer season.Fruits are light green, 5-ridged and of medium length.Punjab Padmini: Fruits are quick growing, dark green, hairy, 5-ridged, and remain tender for a longer period.
Matures within 55-60 days after sowing. Parbhani Kranti: Fruits are medium-long with tender smooth surfaces at the marketable stage.Fruits have a good keeping quality.The average yield is 8.5-11.5 t/ha in 120 days.Arka Anamika: Fruits are borne in two flushes.During the first flush, the fruits are borne on the main stem 45-50 days after sowing.During the second flush, the fruits are borne on short branches, which sprout from the middle portion of the main stem.Fruits are spineless with 5-6 ridges, delicate aroma, and good keeping quality.Climatic Conditions, Soils, and Water Management Okra is grown at elevations ranging from sea level to 1600 m.The optimum temperatures for the growth and production of high-quality pods range between 24 and 30Â°C.The crop is sensitive to frost and temperatures below 12Â°C.Okra will grow on a wide range of soils, but it prefers soils high in organic matter.The seeds perform well on fertile, well- drained loamy soil.
When the soil fertility level is low, organic manure, fertilizer, or compost can be applied to improve soil productivity. it must be frequently fertilized in sandy soils, as soluble nutrients readily leach from the root zone.Its optimum range of soil pH is between 5.8 and 6.5.A soil test will indicate if lime is required to adjust the pH and the amount to apply.If lime is recommended, dolomite should be used and applied 3 to 4 months before the crop is seeded.Okra is sensitive to salinity.Okra can grow in a wide range of rainfall regimes but needs 400 mm of water for the growing period of about 3 months.Uses Okra is mainly consumed as a vegetable and it provides health benefits such as; strengthening bones, lowers blood pressure, prevents constipation and maintains healthy skin.Planting procedure Land preparation Thorough soil preparation 2 to 3 months before planting is recommended to allow crop residues and organic matter in the soil to decompose before okra is planted.
Early land preparation also permits weed seeds to germinate and allows early cultivation to destroy young weeds before planting. Soil management The crop produces reasonably well on most soil types, although a fertile loam is preferable.Cultivars that are susceptible to root-knot eelworm (Meloidogyne incognita) do not produce a satisfactory crop on infected light or sandy soils.This species tolerates soils that are slightly acidic and will grow successfully in soils with a pH of 6.0-6.8.Sowing Okra plants may be established by direct seeding in the field, by growing seedlings in nursery seedbeds, or by raising seedlings in plastic trays.Before planting, it is advisable to soak the okra seeds in water for 24 hours,Â to break seed dormancy and speed up the germination rate or reduce germination days.In Kenya, okra is sown directly in the field.About 8 to 10 kg of seed is required per hectare.The planting depth is about 1.5 cm.
Spacing varies from 45 x 45 cm, 50 x 30 cm, or 60 x 15 cm between the rows and within the rows, respectively. In some parts of Kenya, okra is planted 2 x 2 m in flood irrigation basins.Spacing of about 1 to 2 feet intra-row and 3 to 4 feet inter-row should be used.The main export season in Kenya is October to May; hence planting should start in July to target this export season.However, with irrigation okra can be grown all year round for the local and off-season export markets.Field Operations Fertilizer application Before planting, manure or artificial fertilizer has to be mixed well into the top 10 cm of the soil.The uptake of minerals is rather high.When the crop yields 10 t of fresh fruits per hectare, the uptake is 100 kg N, 10 kg P, 60 kg K, 80 kg Ca, and 40 kg Mg.Fertilizer can be given in three split applications, at sowing, after 3 weeks, and again at 6 weeks after sowing.
The general recommendation in Kenya (issued by Horticultural Crops Development Authority) for conventional production (non-organic production) is as follows: well-composted manure should be applied at planting at the rate of 15 to 20 t/ha (17 to 20 gm/plant). It should be mixed thoroughly with the soil in the planting hole.Weeding Okra is harvested over a long period and weed control is important throughout the cropping season.Smallholder growers in Kenya control weeds by hand hoeing.Rotation Okra should be rotated with baby corn, maize, peas, onions, potatoes, fodder grass, or small grains.Being in the same family as cotton it shares the same complex of pests and diseases therefore okra should not be grown before or after cotton.Irrigation Okra is a heavily foliaged crop, so its water requirements are high.According to the Kenya Ministry of Agriculture, okra needs 400 mm of water during the growing season of three months.
A general guideline for semi-arid areas, where okra is mostly grown in Kenya, is to provide about 35 mm of water per week (this equals 35 liters of water per square meter). Critical times for irrigating okra are at emergence and from flowering to pod production.Saline or chlorinated water should not be used for irrigation.Harvesting Early-maturing cultivars give the first harvest 7 weeks after sowing.A developing fruit should be harvested 7-8 days after flowering.Earlier picking depresses yields because of suboptimal fruit weight.Delayed picking depresses marketable yields because over-aged fruits become fibrous.Therefore, okra fields are harvested at intervals of 2-3 days.For seed production, the whole crop can be harvested at once.As the plant continues to flower, fruits can be picked every 2 days.Picking fruits is usually done manually.Intensive contact with slightly hairy fruits and plants may lead to skin irritation.
Most varieties grown in Kenya are ready to pick 45 to 55 days after planting. Pods are ready for harvesting about 4 to 6 days after flowering.Pods are harvested when still tender and on attaining a length of 7 to 15 cm, depending on variety and market requirements.Regular picking every 1 to 2 days is essential to ensure pods are within the size prescribed by the market.Okra should not be harvested when it is raining or excessively wet.Excess moisture can induce mold development on the pods and the cut petioles.Okra pods decay quickly; therefore they should be harvested within a day to market.Harvesting is done by hand.The pods can be snapped off or cut off, leaving a small stalk not longer than one cm.The pods must be handled carefully otherwise they may be bruised and may discolor.It is best to pick pods into a waist bag to reduce skin damage and to avoid excessive bending of the pods.Wearing rubber gloves when harvesting and handling pods is recommended.
This will protect the skin from irritating sap produced by the okra plant. Postharvest Treatment After harvesting, the fruits can be stored for only 3-5 days at about 10Â°C; lower temperatures may cause damage to the fruits.Okra should not be washed until shortly before use as washing makes the fruit slimy.Fresh okra can quite easily be transported in bulk and kept for several days without much loss of quality.Dried okra is an important product in West Africa.Some countries have a small canning and freezing industry.References Aguair, J.L., McGiffin, M., Natwick, E.& Takele, E.(2011).Okra production in California.UC Vegetable Research and Information Center.Available at: http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/7210.pdf.[Accessed 24 January 2023].CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Abelmoschus esculentus (okra) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/1950.[Accessed 24 January 2023].

Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Green peach aphid, Potato aphid, etc.) Myzus persicae Macrosiphum euphorbiae Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insects Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Armyworms (Beet armyworm, Western striped armyworm) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera praefica Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Corn earworm Helicoverpa zea Symptoms Larvae damage leaves, buds, flowers and pods;

Crop details The following are the crop details for onion. Local Names: Kitunguu, (Swahili), Gitunguru (Kikuyu) KitunguruÂ (Maragoli).Scientific Name: Allium cepa Order: Asparagales Family: Amaryllidaceae Subfamily: Allioideae Genus: Allium Species: A.Â cepa Other names: bulb onionÂ orÂ common onion Onion foliage Pink onion flowers Onion bulb Onion Content Onion flower Onion plants Onion bulbs General Information Being a biennial vegetable onion is grown as an annual in temperate zones.The varieties that thrive in the tropics are effectively annuals because they can produce seed within the first year of growth.The plant's stem is a flattened disc with tubular leaves that form a pseudo stem where their sheaths overlap.There are 3-8 leaves per plant that are either erect or oblique.The plant produces p ink or white flowers cluster on its stalks.The bulbs are formed just above the flattened stem of the plant by overlapping leaves.
Onions may also be referred to as cultivars and these include red or purple onions, shallots, and spring onions or scallions. They are particularly suited to smallholder farming in most countries.In the tropics onions can be grown year-round where irrigation is possible.The bulb is made up of layers, each of which corresponds to a leaf.They are generally oval, but their shape can vary, and they appear in clusters of 3-18 per plant.It is shielded by a membrane that transforms into a paper coat.Onion plants can grow to a height of 50 cm (20 in) and are grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season; however, in the tropics, onions can be grown year-round if irrigation is available.Varieties The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented.Ancient records of onion use span western and eastern Asia, so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain.Yet, domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia.
Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran, western Pakistan and Central Asia. Onion Varieties in Kenya Red Creole: This is a popular standard variety in high demand because of its good keeping quality.It produces mainly single onions from transplants, red, flat-round, and with a pungent taste.Red Tropicana : Red bulbing type Red Tropicana F1 Hybrid : Produces large, red, thick flat onions with firm pungent flesh.It is highly productive and therefore demands high levels of management.It keeps well in a dry aerated store.Bombay Red: It is a variety of dry and warmer conditions.It is small to medium-sized, globe-shaped, purplish red, and pungent.Yellow Granex FI Hybrid: This is an early maturing high yielding attractive, thick flat onion with thin yellow scales.The flesh is medium firm, crisp, and mild in flavor.The shape and size are uniform leading to higher market prices, and the storage quality is good.
Texas early Grano: This is a fresh market, early maturing variety (100 - 120 days) with a rather short shelf life. It is yellowish, mild, and not very pungent.The bulbs are high-top shaped with dry yellow scales.It is a heavy yielder for high-altitude regions.Ideal for fish salads.White Creole: This is a white variety normally used for dehydration.Green bunching: non-bulbing spring onion.It has attractive tasty dark greenÂ leaves.It is an early and highly productive onion grown for stems rather than bulbs.It is tolerant to sun scotch and it is recommended for salads and fresh markets.Onion Varieties in East Africa In Tanzania, Red Bombay is the most popular onion variety.Its production is highest in March, May, and December and is predominantly sourced from Mangâ€™ola.Other popular varieties grown in the East Africa region include Red Pinoy F1, Red Creole, Bombay Red, and Texas Early Grano.
Onion sets are small, immature onion bulbs Transplanting onions from cell trays Transplants can be produced in cell trays Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management In temperate zones, onion is a cool-season biennial and is tolerant to frost. They produce bulbs with growing day lengths.Optimum temperatures for plant development are between 13 and 24Â°C, although the range for seedling growth is narrow, between 20 and 25Â°C.High temperatures favor bulbing and curing.In the tropics, only short-day or day-neutral onion varieties will form bulbs.These thrive in warm to hot climates of 15-30Â°C.If the temperature greatly exceeds that required for bulbing, maturity is hastened and bulbs do not grow to maximum size, consequently lowering the yields.Onions can be grown on any fertile, well-drained, non-crusting soil.The optimum pH range is 6.0 to 6.8, although alkaline soils are also suitable.Onions do not grow well in soils below pH 6.0.On light sandy soils, irrigation is necessary.
Irrigation could be either overhead or on a drip. Onions at the bulbing stage need a substantial amount of water, but excessive moisture must be avoided during the growing season.Avoid the application of fresh manure to the crop, as this will cause the plants to develop thick necks and too many leaves at the expense of bulb formation.Uses The bulb is an edible vegetable and is the most commonly used part of the onion, usually consumed after cooking although it can be eaten fresh.The stems and leaves are also edible.In general, onions are used for salads (bunching onions or sliced full-grown bulbs), pickling (e.g.silver skin onions), cooking (such as in soups), and frying (for example, with meat).Â It also plays an important role in traditional medicine (e.g.as a diuretic).Planting Procedure The planting procedure for onion is as follows: A grower must consider several factors when planting onions, among them are onion varieties.
Onions can be planted in three different ways: by sets transplants or direct seeding. Sets are grown from seeds, producing small bulbs before going dormant.Planting sets and transplants can be advantageous because they are ready to harvest one to two months earlier than onions planted directly.Planting in sets and transplanting is much more expensive than direct seeding.Harvests can be completed earlier in the year when using transplants or sets, which may result in higher profits if the market demand for the produce is higher.Planting sets or transplants necessitate the use of specialized planting equipment.It is necessary to consider the cost of acquiring the necessary equipment.In some environments, using sets and transplants exposes the onion to environmental pressures for a shorter period of time, reducing the need for weed and pest control.A precision seed drill and other onion handling equipment are required for direct seeding.
For direct seeding, the soil must be tilled, smoothed, and leveled prior to seeding. The ideal soil site is well-drained and has a nearly neutral pH (6.6-6.8).(Growing Onions).Direct seeding requires that each seed be planted at the same depth below the soil surface in order for it to germinate and grow uniformly.Typically, seeds are planted 1 inch deep.Planting Systems Nursery seeding andÂ transplantingÂ is the most common and practical option in the tropics.Transplants normally have 3 to 5 well-formed leaves at transplant time.Roots are pruned during planting, in order not to be bent upwards when transferred to the field.This facilitates early establishment of the plant.Any germinated bulb of the above-mentioned varieties would produce 3-6 good size bulbs in about 3 months when planted with the rains.Choose only healthy bulbs for propagation.Sets are used in some areas in the temperate zones to ensure large bulb size and uniform maturity.
Sets are small dry bulbs, approximately 12 mm inÂ diameter, which have been produced the previous season by seeding thickly or growing under conditions thatÂ favorÂ rapidÂ bulbing. Direct seedling is possible and gives excellent results whereÂ herbicidesÂ can be used and the season is sufficiently long to provide earlyÂ pre-bulbingÂ growth.In the tropics this method is impractical due to enormous weeding costs in anÂ organicÂ system.Husbandry Do not plant onions after the field has been planted with other Allium plants (e.g.garlic).Mulching onions with composted leaves and straw is highly recommended to maintain soil organic content, prevent soil-borne diseases, and suppress weeds.Planting onions in raised beds improve drainage and prevents damping-off diseases.Weeding and harvesting are mostly done by hand, although chemical weed control is possible but not organic.Weed control is a critical part of onion production.
Common weeds that affect onion and garlic include yellow nutsedge, field morning glory, cheeseweed, chickweed, henbit, lambs quarters, marestail, pigweed, purslane, shepherdspurse, annual bluegrass, barnyardgrass, and foxtail. Onion transplants and seedlings do not compete well with weeds, so hand cultivation or herbicides are necessary if weeds are a problem.Crop rotation is important to avoid the build-up of pests and diseases such as nematodes, Sclerotium and Fusarium.Harvesting Harvesting takes place 90-150 days after sowing.Onions are ready for harvest when the leaves collapse.Alternatively, the leaves can be bent over and left to dry for 10-12 days.The crop is pulled out by hand and kept for some days in the field with the bulbs covered by the leaves (= windrowing).The leaves are then cut off and the mature bulbs are bagged or packed in crates if they are to be stored.Freshly harvested onions are dormant and will not sprout for a variable period (this depends on the variety).
Storage will extend the dormant period. Sprouting will increase in storage temperatures above 4.4Â°C.It will decrease again as temperatures exceed 25Â°C.Postharvest Treatment Onion bulb curing Following harvest, bulbs are cured to heal wounds and for drying.Curing improves postharvest handling characteristics and limits the entry of organisms through the pseudostems or injured tissues.It also helps the formation of attractive, well-colored, intact outer skins.When weather permits, bulbs are cured in the field for several days, depending on environmental conditions, until the neck has sealed, the outer scales are papery and the wounds have healed.For field or indoor curing at ambient temperature, bulbs are windrowed to air-dry or placed into well- ventilated boxes or bags, respectively.Onions can also be cured with forced circulation of warm (30Â°C), low-humidity air through bins or piles of onions placed on slatted floors for 12-24 h.
During curing, onion can lose as much as 5% of its initial harvest weight. Onion storage Green onions should be stored at 0Â°C and 95% RH with a storage life of up to 3 weeks.At 5Â°C, storage life may be limited to 1 week.Best storage occurs after bulbs have been cured to seal bulbs and heal damage as described above.Onion bulbs do not heal cuts and surface wounds as successfully as other crops such as Irish potato, so mechanical damage during harvest and handling should be minimized before storage.Decay, sprouting, and rooting cause losses during storage.These losses can be minimized by storage at or near 0Â°C and 65-70% RH.Storage at high temperatures (25-35Â°C) may also be satisfactory.Dry matter and moisture are lost during storage.Most bulbs shrink in size due to respiratory losses and carbohydrate translocation from the outer to inner scales or sprouting roots and shoots.
This reallocation of resources causes the succulent outermost scales to gradually desiccate, becoming a dry protective layer, further reducing water loss from the inner scales. Bulb diameter decreases because of the net loss of succulent scales over time.Onion respiration rates are temperature dependent, decreasing with refrigerated storage.Respiratory heat must be removed by ventilation or refrigeration.Relative humidity influences storage life by reducing shrinkage from water loss.Modified atmosphere storage with elevated CO2 and reduced O2 can extend onion storage life.As a general rule, long-day types with high solids have longer storage potential than short-day types with low solids.Pungent cultivars generally have longer storage potential than sweet.A fully cured pungent bulb may be stored under optimal conditions for up to 1 year.In contrast, a sweet cultivar may only last 2-3 months under similar conditions.
Bulb rest and dormancy Onion bulb dormancy is complex with different phases. Onion bulbs first enter a state of rest at harvest maturity that lasts 6-8 weeks.After the rest period, a natural dormancy period begins and bulbs will not sprout or grow because inhibitors synthesized in green leaves earlier in development remain.The inhibitors are gradually destroyed with time.Therefore, it is important to have normal senescence of onion leaves to ensure translocation of inhibitors to the bulb to improve storage life and reduce early sprouting.The change from rest to dormancy is gradual and highly dependent on the cultivar.Dormant bulbs will not sprout at optimal storage temperatures.Once dormancy has passed, root emergence occurs, followed by leaf shoots at favorable temperatures and moisture conditions.Bulb sprouting and sprout inhibition Sprouting is optimum at 10-15Â°C.Sprouting is inhibited at both low and high temperatures as explained above.
For long-term storage, a spray inhibitor such as maleic hydrazide (MH) is sometimes used, but it is banned in many countries. MH at a concentration of 2500 ppm is applied at 500 L water/ha.Spray inhibitors are generally applied in the field 1-2 weeks before harvest.If applied too soon, foliage injury occurs and when applied too late, foliar absorption is insufficient to be effective.To improve absorption, applications are made when most of the foliage is still green and when dew is not present.Onions treated with MH and held at a temperature between âˆ’1Â°C and 0Â°C and 65-70% RH can be stored for as long as 6-7 months without sprouting.Bulb rooting and sprouting are inhibited by gamma irradiation and controlled-atmosphere storage at reduced O2, and continuous removal of newly formed roots tends to delay sprout emergence.References Boyhan, G.E.& Kelley, W.T.(Eds.)

The orange tree is branched with a rounded crown and possesses elliptical or oval leaves which are alternately arranged on the branches. The leaves have narrowly winged petioles, a feature that distinguishes it from bitter orange, which has broadly winged petioles.The tree produces white flowers singly or clustered on a raceme.The fruit is a spherical berry with a green-yellow to orange skin covered in indented glands and a segmented pulpy flesh and several seeds.Orange trees can grow to a height of 6â€“15 m (16â€“49 ft) and can live for periods in excess of 100 years.Most plantations have an economic lifespan of around 30 years.Orange may also be referred to as sweet orange or navel orange and is believed to have originated from a wild ancestor in the border between Vietnam and China.

Propagation Requirements Orange is a subtropical plant and the trees grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season.They will grow best at temperatures between 12.8 and 37.8Â°C (55â€“100Â°F) during the growing season and 1.7 to 10Â°C (35â€“50Â°F) during dormancy.Mature orange trees can survive short periods of freezing, whereas young trees will be killed.Trees should be protected from frosts and freezing conditions to prevent damage.The trees will also tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil.Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development.
Orange trees require full sun and should be protected from wind which can cause damage to the trees. Orange propagation Orange seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock as seeds will not produce fruit true to type.Grafting is the process by which a scion from one plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree.Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud.Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well.Budding Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6â€“9 mm/0.25â€“0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant).
Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined.It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees.The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees.The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves.These budsticks can be stored for 2â€“3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding.The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground.
Using a sharp knife, a 2.5â€“3.8 cm (1â€“1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a â€œT-shapeâ€​ The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark.Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud.This piece should measure 1.9â€“2.5 cm(0.75â€“1.0 in) in length.Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant.Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.When the union is made and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem.
This cut should be made 2.5â€“3.9 cm (1.0â€“1.5 in) on the same side as the join. The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground.This process, known as â€œloppingâ€​ allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in lengthe, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.Planting seedlings Orange trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard.The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area.Standard sized trees should be spaced 3.7â€“7.6 m (12â€“25 ft) apart in an area that receives full sunlight, but is protected from strong winds which can damage the trees.Planting against a south facing wall will help protect the tree in cooler climates.General care Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established.
During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3â€“7 days.The soil should be moist, but not wet.Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently.Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year.T-budding showing shield shaped piece of budwood inserted into stem of rootstock References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Citrus sinensis (navel orange) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13466.[Accessed 02 March 15].Paid subscription required .Lacey, K., Ramsey, H.& Hoffman, H.(2009).Growing healthy citrus.Government of Western Australia Department of Agriculture and Food.Available at: http://archive.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/hort/fn/cp/citrus_propagation.pdf.[Accessed 02 March 15].Free to access .Lazaneo, V.(2008).

A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of â€œhuang long bingâ€​, which translates to â€œyellow dragon diseaseâ€​, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees.By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively.
The disease has been known by various names in different countries - â€œgreeningâ€​ in South Africa, â€œmottle leafâ€​ in the Philippines, â€œdiebackâ€​ in India and â€œvein phloem degenerationâ€​ in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant.The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter.It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L.
africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L.asiaticus , found in .A third species, L.americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements.As this species is found in the same areas as L.asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements.Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting.The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar.Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew.
Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed.They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers.When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days.In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur.It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments.
Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956.The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured.Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest.Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus.
Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified.In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms.(ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays.Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T.eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk.In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease.Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.

Oregano plants can be woody or herbaceous and possess multiple branching stems. The leaves are oval or round and are arranged alternately on the stems.The plants produce small pink, purple or white flowers and small oval, brown fruits and can reach up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in height.Oregano is perennial and can be grown for 3â€“4 years but is commonly grown as an annual in northern climates.Oregano may also be referred to as European oregano or wild marjoram and originated from the Mediterranean.Oregano plant Oregano flowers Oregano foliage Uses The leaves of the oregano plant are used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking.They may also be dried and used to extract essential oil which is used in soaps or as flavorings in wines and liqueurs.Oregano Content Propagation Basic requirements Oregano is a temperate or subtropical plant and will grow best in ample sunlight but can also be grown in partial shade.The plant grows best in light, well-draining soil with a pH of 4.5â€“8.7.
Oregano will tolerate some cold but will grow best when the annual temperature does not fall below 15Â°C (59Â°F). Propagation Oregano can be grown from seeds, cuttings or by division or layering.Vegetative propagation is best for conserving desirable characteristics.Seeds Oregano seeds can be planted indoors to produce transplants or direct seeded.When direct seeding, seeds should be sown in rows spaced 50â€“60 cm (19â€“24 in) apart with seedlings thinned to allow 20 cm (8 in) between plants.Seeds will germinate in 4 days at a temperature of 21Â°C (70Â°F).Cuttings Root divisions and cuttings are best taken in late Spring when plant growth is at a maximum.Softwood cuttings taken from the new plant growth are quickest to root.Remove portions of stem 7.6â€“12.7 cm (3â€“5 in) in length using a sharp knife.Cut the stem at a 45Â° angle.Plant the cuttings in a light potting medium such as peat moss and vermiculite and keep moist until rooted.
General care and maintenance Oregano grows very vigorously and requires little care. When the plant has reached approximately 15 cm (6 in) in height, pinching the growing tips will encourage the plant to branch.Oregano may be fertilized on a yearly basis with a balanced fertilizer.Once established, oregano requires little water.Supplemental irrigation may be applied during very dry spells.Divide established plants every few years to promote productivity and prevent the plant from becoming woody.Harvesting Organo is best harvested just before flowering.The entire plant can be harvested by clipping the branches to leave only the lowest set of leaves.The leaves can be used fresh or they can be dried for longer storage.The clipped plant will begin to set out new growth within 2 weeks of harvest.References Herb Society of America (2005).Oregano & marjoram.An Herb Society of America Fact Sheet.Available at: http://www.herbsociety.org/factsheets/oregano.pdf.[Accessed 03 March 15].

Family: Caricaceae Genus: Carica.General information Pawpaw (Carica papaya L.) is a popular tropical American fruit.It is commonly cultivated for its small to large melon-like fruit.The type of inflorescence produced by papaya trees reflects whether the tree is male, female, or hermaphrodite.Male trees have many flowers on long, pendulous panicles, whereas female trees have solitary flowers or clusters of a few yellow-green flowers.The papaya fruit is a large fleshy berry with smooth green skin that turns yellow or orange when ripe.The fruit's flesh is thick and succulent, ranging in color from yellow to red or orange.Many black wrinkled seeds are present in the fruit.Papaya trees can live for up to 25 years and grow to a height of 2-10 m (6.6-33 ft).To ensure maximum productivity, plantations are typically replaced every three years.
Papaya, also known as pawpaw, is thought to have originated in the Caribbean region of Central America.

Uses The ripe fruits are high in vitamins C and A, which are frequently lacking in the diets of people living in the tropics. Immature fruits are stewed or boiled as a vegetable in some countries, such as the Philippines.The unripe fruits of the C.papaya tree contain papain, a substance used commercially as a meat tenderizer.Crumpled leaves are used as a meat tenderizer in Southern Asia before wrapping meats.Papain also has medicinal and industrial applications, such as tanning leather, preventing wool shrinkage, and keeping beer clear during the brewing process.Propagation Basic information Papaya is a tropical plant that grows best in temperatures ranging from 21 - 33Â°C in frost-free areas.Papaya can be grown in a variety of soils as long as adequate drainage is provided, but it grows best in light, well-draining soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5.A monthly rainfall of about 4 inches is required for papaya.
Supplemental irrigation should be provided for trees in areas with low rainfall. Water-logged soils should be avoided because trees are extremely sensitive to flooding.Papaya trees are also susceptible to high winds, and tall trees can easily topple.Planting should be avoided in windy areas.Seed propagation Pawpaw is almost entirely propagated from seeds in commercial cultivation.Seeds may be sown in trays filled with a suitable medium, peat pots, polyethylene bags, or directly in the field.Germination occurs in 12-20 days.Seedlings are transplanted into 7.6 cm peat pots or 10 cm plastic bags at the two-leaf (cotyledonary leaves) stage, preferably at the onset of the rainy season.Care should be taken during transplanting to avoid disturbing the roots.After planting out.Container-grown seedlings should be gradually hardened in sunlight before being field-transplanted 1.5-2 months after germination, at about 20 cm high and at the 8- to 12-leaf stage.
Up to 15-20 seeds are sown in each hole during field planting. Upon germination, seedlings are thinned out to leave five or six seedlings to grow to flower.At first flowering, a vigorous plant of the desired sex is kept and the others removed.Cultivation Site preparation and planting Field preparation in many areas is poorly done due to lack of appropriate equipment or rough terrain.On heavy or compacted soils, subsoiling or ripping down to 50 cm or more is desirable to allow roots to penetrate deeply.Planting holes 30-45 cm in diameter are best dug with a tractor-mounted soil auger.If there is a chance of flooding, raised beds are used.After about 6-8 weeks in the nursery, the seedlings should reach the 8- to 12-leaf stage and are most suitable for field planting.In rain-fed areas, field planting is done at the beginning of the rainy season.Seedlings grown in pots and bags are planted directly, with the removal of the pot or bags.
Transplanted plants must be watered soon after planting to settle the soil around the root system. Spacing between plants and between rows varies widely.Universally practiced is the single-row system, with plant spacing ranging from 1.8 to 3 m and between-row spacing varying from 1.8 m to as much as 3.6 m.The between-row spacing largely depends upon the degree of mechanization; a standard tractor requires approx.3 m.The most frequently used spacing is 2.0-2.5 m within row Ã— 2.5 m, giving a density of 1600-2000 plants/ha.The double-row system, with 2 m between a set of rows and 3.5 m between double rows, is used.Normally, two or three seedlings are planted in each hole, spaced about 30 cm apart.Pawpaw general care and maintenance Weeds are a major source of competition for papaya seedlings, so keep the areas around the trees weed-free.Weeds can be effectively suppressed by a layer of mulch around the plants.
To meet the nutrient requirements for fruit production, papaya necessitates regular fertilizer applications. Fertilizer is typically applied 2-4 times per year in commercial plantations.In the home garden, 1/4 cup of a balanced fertilizer applied every 14 days is usually sufficient.The amount of fertilizer should be increased as the trees mature.When the trees are 7 to 8 months old, 1-2 pounds of complete fertilizer should be applied every 2 months.Papaya trees should be watered regularly, particularly during hot, dry periods.Papaya trees do not require pruning but it is good practice to remove any dead leaves from the tree.Harvesting Papaya fruits typically take 22-26 weeks to mature.The fruits can be picked when one-fifth of the fruit surface has turned from green to yellow, but leaving them on the tree longer increases the fruit's sugar content.Fruit can be twisted or snapped off the tree, or it can be cut usingÂ a sharp knife.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).

Cause Virus Comments Virus is transmitted by several aphid species.
Management Infected plants should be removed and destroyed to prevent spread of the virus; new planting materials should be free of the virus; intercropping papaya with a non-host such as corn can help to reduce the incidence of the disease in papaya orchards by providing aphid vectors with an alternative feeding site.
Category : Oomycete Phytophthora fruit rot (Stem rot) Phytophthora palmivora Fruit rot due to Phytopthora Phytophthora infected tree Symptoms of Phytophthora infection on papaya fruit Symptoms of Phytophthora infection on papaya fruit Phytophthora stem rot affected papaya tree Phytophthora infected fruit Phytophthora on papaya fruit (after experimental inoculation with pathogen) Symptoms of Phytophthora infection on papaya fruits Phytophthora fruit rot Stem rot symptom Symptoms of Phytophthora infection on papaya fruit Symptoms Water-soaked lesions on unripe fruit that oozes latex; withering fruit; water-soaked lesions on leaf scars of fruit bearing stem; mature fruit covered in white mycelium. Cause Oomycete Comments Fungi survive in soil and enter through wounds in stem; disease often emerges after hurricane damage.
Management Disease can be controlled through the use of appropriate protective fungicides such as mancozeb or copper sulfate; root rot in seedlings can be prevented by planting in holes filled with soil in which papaya has never been grown - by the time the roots extend out of the added soil the plant is no longer susceptible to the disease.
Pests Category : Insects Papaya mealybug Paracoccus marginatus Encyrtid wasp (Acerophagus papayae) used as biocontrol agent for papaya mealybug Papaya mealybugs Mealybugs on papaya leaf Papaya mealybug infestation under the leaf Damage due to Papaya mealybug Mealybugs on papaya Adult papaya mealybugs Papaya mealybug (Paracoccus marginatus) adults Papaya mealybug Papaya mealybug damaged tree Papaya mealybug (Paracoccus marginatus) infested fruit Adults Papaya fruit infested by mealybugs Mealybugs of papaya fruit Damage to papaya tree due to mealybug infestation Papaya mealybug (Paracoccus marginatus) Symptoms Flattened oval to round disc-like insect covered in cottony substance on tree; chlorosis, plant stunting, leaf deformation, early leaf and fruit drop insects attract ants which may also be present; insect colony may also be associated with growth of sooty mold due to fungal colonization of sugary honeydew excreted by the insect.
Cause Insect Comments Insects have a wide host range; often tended by ants which farm them for their sugary honeydew secretions; transmit Cocoa swollen shoot virus. Management Mealybugs can potentially be controlled by natural enemies such as lady beetles but are commonly controlled using chemicals; chemical pesticides may also decrease populations of natural enemies leading to mealybug outbreaks.Scale insects (White peach scale) Pseudaulacaspis pentagona White peach scale (Pseudaulacaspis pentagona) on papaya.Scale insects on papaya.Note - scale species unknown Scale insect infestation Scale insects and damage on papaya fruit Scale insects on papaya.
Note - scale species unknown Symptoms Scale insects cause damage by feeding on twigs, branches and fruit, injecting toxins into the plant as they do so; if the infestation is heavy, gumming may occur on the bark and twigs or entire branches can be killed; insects are flattened discs, or "scales" with no visible legs; scales produce a white waxy coating which eventually turns black (black cap stage). Cause Insect About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms Comments Scale insects overwinter in the black cap stage; winged adult males mate with females which retain their eggs inside the body until they hatch.
Management Populations are often kept in check by natural enemies, including predacious beetles and some wasps - although broad- spectrum insecticides may result in outbreaks of scale by killing off populations of beneficial insects; trees can be sprayed with horticultural oils when dormant which effectively kill scales without damaging natural enemies.

Parsley can reach 30â€“100 cm (12 â€“39 in) in height depending on the variety being grown and is commonly grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season. Parsley may also be referred to as garden parsley and likely originates from the Mediterranean.Parsley flowers Parsley seedling Parsley leaf Parsley flowers Curly parsley Flat leaf parsley Uses Parsley leaves are used fresh or dried as a culinary herb.Fresh leaves are also commonly used as a garnish.The taproot of some cultivars is edible and may be eaten as a vegetable.Essential oil can be extracted from the parsley flowers and is used as a flavoring.Parsley Content Propagation Basic requirements Parsley plants will grow best when planted in bright sunlight or partial shade.Plants grow best at temperatures between 7 and 16Â°C (45â€“61Â°F) in a well-draining loam which is high in organic matter.It will grow optimally when the soil pH is between 4.9 and 8.2.
Propagation Parsley if propagated from seed, either by direct seeding or sowing indoors to produce transplants. Seeds should be sown in the spring when the soil has warmed.Soaking the seeds overnight prior to planting will aid germination.Seeds should be planted no more than 6 mm (0.25 in) deep using 10 to 15 seeds per inch of row space.Seeds should be kept moist and not allowed to dry out.after emergence, seedlings should be thinned to a final spacing of 10â€“15 cm (4â€“6 in) apart, leaving 30â€“60 cm (12â€“24 in) between rows.Parsley should be left in the ground for a second year if the collection of seed is desired.General care and maintenance Parsley is generally very easy to care for.Keep plants productive by clipping the branches to promote new growth.Remove any flower stalks as they form during the first year of growth to prevent the plant going to seed, retaining the flavor of the leaves.Weeds should be removed from around parsley plants by carefully cultivating the soil.
A layer of mulch applied around the plants can help suppress weeds. Fertilizer may be applied to the soil before planting seeds and during the growing season, plants can be side dressed with nitrogen to keep plants productive.Parsley can be overwintered successfully by protecting the plants with a frame or layer of straw.Leaves can be continually harvested over the winter months.Harvesting Parsley is usually ready for harvest about 75 days after sowing, when the plants have reached approximately 20 cm (~8 in) in height.In the home garden, parsley leaves can be harvested as required or whole plants can be harvested and dried for longer storage.If the whole plant is cut, plant growth is usually sufficient to allow for 3 cuttings per year.References Anderson, C.R.Parsley.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/FSA-6091.pdf.[Accessed 04 March 15].Free to access .Brobst, J.E.(2012).Essential facts for parsley Petroselinum crispum .

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Alternaria leaf blight Alternaria petroselini Symptoms Brown-black necrotic lesions on leaves which may have chlorotic margins; lesions expand and coalesce causing the death of leaves and petioles; dark necrosis on crown and upper region of taproot; damping-off of seedlings Cause Fungus Comments Disease spread primarily by planting infected seed Management Plant only pathogen-free seed; apply appropriate foliar fungicide; rotate crops to non-umbelliferous varieties fro a period of 2-4 years if soil-borne fungi Cercospora leaf blight Cercosporidium punctum Symptoms Small, necrotic flecks on leaves which develop a chlorotic halo and expand into tan brown necrotic spots; lesions coalesce and cause leaves to wither, curl and die Cause Fungus Comments Disease can be introduced through infested seed and spread by wind or water splash; symptoms usually occur on younger foliage first Management Plant only pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; plow crop debris into soil ofter harvest; apply appropriate fungicide sprays Crater spot Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Small, water-soaked lesions on crowns or petioles in contact with soil; collapse of petioles; petioles drying; lesions develop a sunken appearance and a dry, firm texture Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by warm, moist conditions and practices which introduce soil contact with crowns and petioles Management Destroy crop debris or plow deeply into soil; avoid planting seeds too deep to prevent petioles coming into contact with soil; apply appropriate protective fungicides at plant bases; rotate crops with non-hosts such as grains to prevent disease building up in the soil Damping-off Pythium spp.
Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Soft, rotting seeds which fail to germinate; rapid death of seedling prior to emergence from soil; collpase of seedlings after they have emerged from the soil caused by water-soaked reddish lesions girdling the stem at the soil line Cause Fungi Comments Damping-off diseases favor conditions which slow seed germination; fungi can be spread in water, contaminated soil or on equipment Management Avoid planting parsley in poorly draining, cool, wet soil; planting in raised beds will help with soil drainage; plant high quality seed that germinates quickly; treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting to eliminate fungal pathogens Powdery mildew Erisyphe heraclei Symptoms Powdery growth on leaves, petioles flowers stalks and bracts; leaves becoming chlorotic; severe infections can cause flowers to become distorted Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can spread long distances in air; disease emergence is favored by high humidity and moderate temperatures; infection is most severe in shaded areas Management Plant tolerant varieties; avoid excess fertilization; protective fungicide applications provide adequate protection; sulfur application can be used in infection occurs early in season Rust Puccinia spp.
Uromyces spp. Nyssopsora spp.
Symptoms Light green discolored lesions on leaves which become chlorotic; yellow-orange pustules on underside of leaves; stems bend and become swollen or distorted; plants may be stunted Cause Fungi Comments Some species infect only parsley while others have alternative hosts which may provide a reservoir for the disease; disease emergence is favored by high humidity Management Plant in well-draining soils to reduce humidity around plants; apply appropriate systemic fungicide Septoria leaf spot Septoria petroselini Close-up of Septoria lesion on parsley Symptoms of Septoria leaf spot on parsley leaf Septoria lesions on parsley leaves Symptoms Small, angular, gray-brown spots with defined red-brown margins on leaves; black fungal fruiting bodies may be visible on surface of lesions; leaves becoming chlorotic and necrotic Cause Fungus Comments Disease spread via infected seed, by contaminated irrigation water and by equipment or people moving through wet plants Management Control of disease is reliant on cultural control methods and good sanitation practices: use pathogen free seeds or treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting; rotate crops; plow plant debris into soil; if disease is present avoid working with infected plants when foliage is wet; apply appropriate protective fungicides Category : Viral Carrot motley dwarf (CMD) Carrot redleaf virus (CRLV) + Carrot mottle virus (CMoV) Symptoms Yellow and red leaves; stunted plant growth Cause Viruses Comments Disease transmitted by aphids; both viruses must be present to cause carrot motley dwarf Management Avoid planting coriander in close proximity to overwintered carrot fields Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Willow-carrot aphid) Cavariella aegopodii Willow-carrot aphid colony Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; willow-carrot aphid will also attack parnip, carrot and celery Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Armyworm Pseudaletia unipuncta Armyworm Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are About available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.
Symptoms Galls on roots which can be up to 3.3 cm (1 in) in diameter but are usually smaller; reduction in plant vigor; yellowing plants which wilt in hot weather Cause Nematode Comments Galls can appear as quickly as a month prior to planting; nematodes prefer sandy soils and damage in areas of field or garden with this type of soil is most likely Management Plant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil ;check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes; solarizing soil can reduce nematode populations in the soil and levels of inoculum of many other pathogens Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Parsnip, Pastinaca sativa , is an herbaceous biennial plant in the family Apiaceae grown for its edible taproot resembling a pale carrot.
The parsnip plant has an erect, branched stem with a rosette of leaves which are oblong or triangular in shape and 30â€“38 cm (12â€“15 in) in length. The leaves at the top of the plant are smaller and attached directly to the stem.The plant produces flowers on umbels which are yellow or orange in color with wide petals.The taproot of the plant is thick and fleshy and can grow between 10 and 23 cm (4â€“9 in) in length.The parsnip plant may grow to a height of 90â€“180 cm (35â€“70 in) in height and is usually grown as an annual for only one growing season.Parsnip may also be referred to as wild parsnip and originates from the Mediterranean.Harvested parsnips Parsnip foliage Uses The parsnip root is primarily eaten as a root vegetable after cooking.May be sliced and turned into crisps.The leaves of the plant are also edible and may be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.
Parsnip Content Propagation Basic requirements Parsnips are cool-season crops which can be planted in early Spring and left in the ground all summer for harvest in the Fall or in the spring of the following year. Parsnips grow best in a well-draining, loose, sandy soil which is free of large rocks and has a pH between 5.8 and 7.5.Parsnips require full sun for optimum development but will tolerate some very light shade.The optimum temperature for their growth is between 15.6 and 18.3Â°C (60â€“65Â°F) and they do not tolerate heat in the same way that carrots do.The plants also require plenty moisture and organic matter.parsnips do very well in raised beds and can also be grown in containers.Sowing seeds Parsnip is usually direct seeded and should be planted 3â€“5 weeks before the last frost date.Soil should be prepared prior to planting by removing rocks and breaking up any hard lumps down to a depth of at least 30 cm (12 in).
It is also beneficial to work some compost into the soil prior to planting. Avoid using fresh manure as it can cause forking of the roots.Sow seeds 1.3â€“1.9 cm (0.5â€“0.75 in) deep, planting 2â€“3 seeds per inch of row allowing 46â€“61 between rows.When seedlings reach 2.5 cm (1 in) in height, thin them to a final spacing of 5â€“10 cm (2â€“4 in) between plants by snipping with scissors - this avoids damaging plant roots.General care and maintenance Parsnips benefit from a plentiful moisture supply and should be provided with 2.5 cm (1 in) of water each week.Mulching around the plants helps to conserve moisture and reduce weeds.Plants can also be protected over winter with a thick layer of mulch Any weeds growing around the plants should be carefully removed.The plants should be fertilized 5â€“6 weeks after the seeds are sown.Harvesting For best results, parsnips should not be harvested until after the first light frosts in Fall, when the tops of the plants have frozen.
Frost stimulates the conversion of starch in the roots to sugars giving the roots a sweeter flavor. Care should be taken to harvest before the ground freezes or to cover the plants to prevent freezing.Parsnips are harvested by gently digging around the plant to expose the top of the root and gently, but firmly pulling the root from the soil by grasping the top of the parsnip just above the root.Parsnip tops should be twisted off and the roots washed prior to refrigeration in airtight bags.Parsnips may also be stored in moist sand to keep them fresh prior to use.References Anderson, C.R.Parsnip.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/FSA-6092.pdf.[Accessed 04 March 15].Free to access .Delahaut, K.A.& Newenhouse, A.C.(1998).Growing carrots, radishes, beets and other root crops in Wisconsin.A guide for fresh-market growers.University of Wisconsin-Extension.Available at: http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3686.PDF.

Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Soft, rotting seeds which fail to germinate; rapid death of seedling prior to emergence from soil; collpase of seedlings after they have emerged from the soil caused by water-soaked reddish lesions girdling the stem at the soil line Cause Fungi Comments Damping-off diseases favor conditions which slow seed germination; fungi can be spread in water, contaminated soil or on equipment Management Avoid planting parsnips in poorly draining, cool, wet soil; planting in raised beds will help with soil drainage; plant high quality seed that germinates quickly; treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting to eliminate fungal pathogens Downy mildew Peronospora umbellifarum Symptoms Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; white fluffy growth on underside of leaves; lesions become darker as the mature Cause Fungus Comments Disease affects young, tender leaves; disease emergence and spread is favored by prolonged leaf wetness Management Plant pathogen-free seed; do not overcrowd plants; rotate crops with non-umbelliferous varieties Itersonilia canker Itersonilia perplexans Symptoms Small brown necrotic lesions on leaves with pale green halos; lesions may coalesce to form large necrotic patches; gray to black lesions on bases of petioles; red-brown cankers on root crown and shoulder with rough texture Cause Fungus Comments Disease typically emerges late in growing season and emergence is favored by cool, wet weather conditions Management The disease can be reduced by keeping the shoulder of parsnip roots covered with soil throughout the growing season; inoculum can be reduced by rotating crops, planting in well-draining soils, removing weeds and plowing crop debris into soil after harvest Powdery mildew Erisyphe heraclei Symptoms Powdery growth on leaves, petioles flowers stalks and bracts; leaves becoming chlorotic; severe infections can cause flowers to become distorted Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can spread long distances in air; disease emergence is favored by high humidity and moderate temperatures; infection is most severe in shaded areas Management Plant tolerant varieties; avoid excess fertilization; protective fungicide applications provide adequate protection; sulfur application can be used in infection occurs early in season Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Willow-carrot aphid) Cavariella aegopodii Willow-carrot aphid colony Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; willow-carrot aphid will also attack parnip, parsley and celery Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Carrot rust fly Psila rosae Carrot rust fly Symptoms Surface scarring of taproot caused by tunnels; tunnels are filled with a rust colored mush; adult insect is a small, dark colored fly; larvae are white maggots approximately 1 cm (0.3 in) long Cause Insect Comments Carrot rust fly also attacks carrot, celery and other Umbelliferous crops which will also need to be protected if carrot rust fly is a problem Management Use of row covers will help to protect plants from damage but they must be installed before adult fly lays eggs on plants; harvest parsnips in blocks; do not leave any parsnips in the ground over winter to reduce overwintering sites Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm feeding on plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Pea, Pisum sativum , is an annual herbaceous legume in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds and seedpods.
The pea plant can be bushy or climbing, with slender stems which attach to a substrate using tendrils. Each leaf has 1â€“3 pairs of oval leaflets and can reach 1â€“6 cm in length.The plant produces white, red or purple flowers and swollen or compressed green seedpods which can be straight or curved.The pods can range in size from 4 to 15 cm long and 1.5â€“2.5 cm wide.Each pod contains between 2 and 10 seeds, or peas.The pea plant is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach 30â€“150 cm in height.Pea may also be referred to as garden pea, English pea or green pea and likely originates from Southwest Asia.Pea pod and seeds Pea tendrils grasping a support Pea pods Pea flower Pea plants Uses Young green seeds and pods can be eaten fresh or cooked as a vegetable.Pea Content Propagation Basic requirements Peas are cool-season crops and should be grown in early Spring or late summer to avoid high summer temperatures.
Peas grow best at temperatures between 15 and 24Â°C (60â€“75Â°F) and are tolerant of frost down to -6.5Â°C (20Â°F) although they are generally less sensitive to Spring frost. Pea plants will grow best in soils rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.5 and 7.They should be planted in a well draining soil or raised bed as they do not tolerate too much moisture.Peas perform best in full sunlight although they are also tolerant of partial shade.Sowing seeds Peas should be direct seeded in the garden in Spring as soon as soil is workable and its temperature is above 4.4Â°C (40Â°F), or in late summer 8â€“10 weeks before the first frost date.The optimum soil temperature for germination is 10â€“25Â°C(50â€“77Â°F), lower temperatures will slow germination.Seeds should be planted 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) with shallow planting beneficial in soils which are cool and wet.Seeds should be sown 2.5â€“10.0 cm (1â€“4 in) apart allowing 45 cm (~18 in) between rows.
Seedling should emerge in 9â€“13 days at a soil temperature of 15.5Â°C (60Â°F) and do not require thinning. General care and maintenance Tall, vining pea varieties require a trellis to support their growth.Trellises can be made easily out of chicken wire or lengths of string and the plants will begin to grow around them, using tendrils to grip around the support.If growing a variety that requires trellising then the row spacing should be adjusted accordingly.Cool season crops are often attacked by powdery mildew and where the disease is known to be problematic, resistant varieties should be planted.Pea trellis Peas growing on string supports Pea supports Peas growing on a home made trellis Vining peas will use tendrils to grasp around supports Pea seedlings should emerge in 9â€“13 days at optimal soil temperature References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Pisum sativum (pea) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/41042.[Accessed 05 March 15].

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Aphanomyces root rot (Common root rot) Aphanomyces euteiches Symptoms Leaves turning yellow starting from bottom of plant and moving upwards; pod production reduced; soft dark lesions on roots; plants may be severely stunted Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors high soil moisture; currently a problem in the midwest and northeast US Management No fungicides effectively control this disease and no pea varieties with high resistance, control therefore relies on avoiding planting in infested fields; rotate crops to avoid build up of disease in soil Ascochyta disease Mycosphaerella pinodes Phoma medicaginis Ascochyta pisi Ascochyta lesions on pods and leaves Symptoms Tan or purple lesions on leaves, stems and pods which may expand and produce a concentric ring pattern; blossoms or pods may drop or become distorted if lesions girdle sepals Cause Fungi Comments Disease emergence favors high moisture Management Grow peas in dry areas; use an appropriate fungicide to treat seeds prior to planting; discard any seed which is known to be heavily infected Brown spot Psuedomonas syringae Symptoms Water-soaked spots on leaves, stems and pods identical to those caused by bacterial blight; after several days lesions turn tan, lose their water-soaked appearance and resemble a scorch or burn; stem lesions are sunken and elongated and spread upwards; symptomatic leaves dry and drop from plant Cause Bacterium Comments Disease is spread by infected seed; bacterium survives in soil for several months; brown spot more common on plants injured by wind, frost and hail or by mechanical means Management Plant only disease-free seed; continuously rotate crops; avoid planting peas in fall when they are more likely to be injured by inclement weather Downy mildew Peronospora viciae Symptoms Yellow-brown blotches on upper surface of leaves; angular patches of fluffy white-gray fungus on lower side of leaves; plant growth may be stunted or distorted and whole plant may die before flowering; plant may produce Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in soil and on crop debris; fungus can survive in soil for 10-15 years Management Rotate crops for at least 5 years; till crop debris deeply; avoid sowing pea in late Autumn at greater soil depths as this can promote severe infections Fusarium root rot Fusarium solani Symptoms Stunted plant growth; yellowing, necrotic basal leaves; brown-red or black streaks on roots that coalesce as they mature; lesions may spread above the soil line Cause Fungus Comments Damage caused by the emergence of the disease is worsened by warm, compacted soils, limited soil moisture and poor soil fertility Management There are currently no pea varieties with resistance to Fusarium root rot so control relies on cultural practices e.g.
do not plant peas in same area more than once in any 5 year span or treating seeds with an appropriate fungicide prior to planting Gray mold (Botrytis mold) Botrytis cinerea Symptoms Fuzzy gray elongated lesions whoch girdle stem causing wilting of upper parts of plant; lower leaves may be covered in fuzzy gray growth which causes them to dry out and shrivel; small, oval, water-soaked lesions on pods which are tan in color; pod lesions spread irregularly and become gray and sunken; young pods may shrivel and become covered in fuzzy, gray mycelial growth Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives in or on crop debris in soil; disease spreads by splashing water and on equipment under favorable conditions Management There is no reported resistance to gray mold in pea; potassium deficiency may make plants more susceptible and should be supplemented in deficient soils; the fungus causing gray mold has developed resistance to many systemic fungicides and control relies on the application of an appropriate protective fungicides if flowering and pod set coincides with wet weather Powdery mildew Erysiphe pisi Powdery mildew on pea Powdery mildew on pea Symptoms Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; powdery gray-white areas which coalesce to cover entire plant; if plant is heavily infected it may appear light blue or gray in color Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters on plant debris or alternate host; disease emergence is favored by warm, dry weather with cool nights that result in dew formation Management Plant resistant varieties, particularly if sowing late; use overhead irrigation (washes fungus from leaves and reduces viability); plant crop as early as possible; frequent applications of sulfur may be required to control heavy infestations Rhizoctonia seedling blight Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Water-soaked sunken, red-brown lesions on hypocotyls (germinating shoot below seed leaves) and epicotyls (shoot above seed leaves); death of growing tip as it emerges from soil; new shoots may emerge from a node at seed but may also be killed Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for long periods; disease most damaging in warm conditions; fungus spreads by wind, contaminated water, equipment and movement of people and animals in plantation Management Crop rotation helps to reduce the build up of the fungus in the soil; reduce soil compaction; do not plant seeds too deep Septoria blotch Septoria pisi Septoria blotch symptoms on pea Septoria lesions on pea pods Septoria blotch symptoms on pea Septoria lesions on pea foliage Septoria blotch symptoms on pea Symptoms Irregular yellow lesions on leaves and pods with no definitive margin that coalesce to form large yellow patches; large patches may dry out and become covered in black fungal fruiting bodies Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors high humidity and moderate temperatures; disease is common but rarely causes economic damage as it occurs mainly on old leaves and pods Management Rotating crops regularly prevents disease build-up in soil Category : Bacterial Bacterial blight Pseudomonas syrngae Symptoms Small, water-soaked spots on leaves steam and pods which coalesce and turn brown and necrotic; lesions on leaves are angular and develop translucent centers; lesions on stem may enlarge and girdle stem, killing plant parts above; lesions on pods may cause seeds to be covered in slime Cause Bacterium Comments Disease is spread both in and on seed and can survive like this for 3 years; if infected seed is used, the whole pea crop can be lost if conditions are favorable to the bacterium Management Plant resistant varieties; plant only disease-free seed; disinfect all tools and equipment regularly; avoid sprinkler irrigation Streak Pea streak virus (PSV) Symptoms Purple or brown necrotic streaks on stems and petioles; small brown necrotic lesions on leaves; brown, sunken lesions on pods; pods fail to fill properly or do not fill at all; pods discolored; dieback of growing tips; chlorosis of leaves Cause Virus Comments Transmitted by pea aphids; alfalfa most important perennial virus reservoir Management No resistance to virus; avoid planting peas close to established alfalfa; insecticide application of little benefit due to short time aphid requires to transmit virus but can help control secondary spread Category : Viral Enation mosaic Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) Symptoms Blister-like outgrowths (enations) on underside of leaves and on pods; leaves with translucent areas; severely deformed plants Cause Virus Comments Virus is transmitted by several species of aphid Management In areas where virus is a problem, early planting may allow plants to mature before virus becomes severley damaging; control of aphid populations and hosts plants which act as reservoirs can help control spread of virus Mosaic Red clover vein mosaic virus (RCVMV) Symptoms Mottled patterns on leaves; yellow leaf veins; distorted leaves; stunted plants which often die Cause Virus Comments Virus transmitted by aphids; aphids acquire virus from perennial hosts such as clover and alfalfa and spread to peas Management No known resistance to virus, control depends on control of aphid populations; apply appropriate insecticide if aphid populations are significant Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Pea aphid, Bean aphid, Cowpea aphid, Melon aphid, Peach aphid, etc.) Acyrthosiphon pisum Aphis spp.
Myzus persicae Close-up image of a pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plant Cause Insects Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Leafminers Lyriomyza spp.
Typical leafminer trail Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larvae hatch and feed on leaf interior Cause Insects Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies Mexican bean beetle Epilachna varivestis Mexican bean beetle larva Egg cluster Adult beetle Symptoms Irregular patches of feeding damage on underside of leaves which causes the top surface of the leaf to dry out, giving the leaves a lacy appearance; insect will also damage flowers and small pods; pods may be damaged so badly that they drop from the plant; adult insect is an orange-brown beetle with black spots; larvae are fat-bodied grubs which taper at the end and are in rows of conspicuous spines Cause Insect Comments Beetles can decimate bean crops; beetles overwinter as adults and undergo 2-3 generations per year Management Some bean varieties may be less attractive hosts for the beetle, e.g.
snapbeans are preferred hosts over lima beans; early varieties may escape damage form beetles beetle populations can be reduced by remove overwintering sites such as brush and leaves on the ground; handpick larvae and adults; brush eggs from leaves and destroy; apply insecticidal soap to leaf undersides if infestation is heavy Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.
Symptoms Galls on roots which can be up to 3.3 cm (1 in) in diameter but are usually smaller; reduction in plant vigor; yellowing plants which wilt in hot weather Cause Nematode Comments Galls can appear as quickly as a month prior to planting; nematodes prefer sandy soils and damage in areas of field or garden with this type of soil is most likely Management About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms Management Plant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil ;check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes; solarizing soil can reduce nematode populations in the soil and levels of inoculum of many other pathogens Category : Mites Spider mites (Two-spotted spider mite) Tetranychus urticae Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Peach, Prunus persica , is a deciduous tree or shrub in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruit of the same name.
The peach tree is relatively short with slender and and supple branches. The leaves are alternately arranged, slender and pointed.The tree produces pink flowers which have five petals and emerge in January and February.The fruit is a velvety, soft, fleshy red to yellow-orange fruit which is oval in shape and 3-8 cm in diameter.Peach trees can grow up to 8 m (19 ft) in height and produce fruit for 10 to 20 years.Peach may also be referred to as nectarine, the two fruits belonging to the same species, although nectarines have smooth skin, and are believed to have originated in China.Peach skin Harvest Flower close-up Peaches Peach blossoms Peach trees blossoming Peach fruit and stone Peach fruits on the tree Peach Peach Content Uses Peach trees are primarily grown for their fruit which is consumed fresh.Peach trees are also grown as ornamental plants.
Propagation Basic requirements Peaches grow best in areas with warm summers and require a summer temperature between 20 and 30Â°C (68-86Â°F) for the fruit to mature. The trees also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy but fruit buds can be damaged by prolonged periods below -15Â°C (5Â°F) and as such, the majority of production takes place in countries which are relatively close to the equator.In addition, peach trees bloom early and can be damaged by late frosts.Trees grow best in well-draining sandy loams in areas that receive full sun but can will grow in a variety of soils as long as water does not sit on the surface after heavy rainfall.It can be beneficial to plant the trees on elevated land to allow cold air to drain away.Trees will grow optimally in soils with a pH of 6.5.Propagation Peach trees are propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent.Commercial trees are usually propagated by T-budding in the summer.
T-budding involves joining a bud from a desired variety onto an appropriate rootstock. Buds can also be collected late in the summer for budding during dormancy.The budwood should be collected from healthy shoots of current season growth, leaves removed and the budwood kept moist until the union with the rootstock is made.The budwood is joined to the rootstock by inserting the bud stick into a T-shaped cut on the bark of the rootstock and allowing it to grow.The rest of the tree is pruned to force the growth of the new bud which has the desired characteristics.Planting Peach trees should be planted in full sun.Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole which is slightly wider than the root ball.Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth ensuring that the bud union is above the soil line.It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark.If planting multiple trees, space them at least 7.6 m (25 ft) apart.
General care and maintenance Peaches should be pruned annually, including the year of planting and are best trained to an open center. When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to prevent the tree from over-bearing.Aim to have 1 fruit every 8 inches.This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year.Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development.During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days.Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy.Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Prunus persica (peach) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/44340.[Accessed 05 March 15].Paid subscription required .Marini, R.P., Peck, J.& Smith, A.J.Growing peaches and nectarines in Virginia.Virginia Cooperative Extension.

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Bacterial Bacterial canker Pseudomonas syringae Canker on peach trunk Canker on peach trunk (bark peeled to show discoloration to tissue underneath) Canker on peach trunk Peach tree with dark cankers on bark Canker on peach trunk Canker exuding gum on infected peach tree Symptoms Cankers on twigs at bases of flower and leaf buds, in pruning wounds or at the base of spurs which exude amber colored gum; cankers spread upwards and form sunken areas in winter; if pathogen enters dormant buds they may be killed or open normally in Spring before collapsing in early Summer; infected buds may be symptomless Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors high moisture and low temperatures in the spring; young trees particularly susceptible; trees grown in sandy soils that drain poorly are also susceptible Management Ensure that a suitable peach variety and rootstock is chosen based on geographic location and environmental conditions to prevent stress to tree which predisposes tree to canker disease; apply protective copper spray to trees before flowering; prune trees in early summer to decrease likelihood of infection Bacterial spot Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms of bacterial spot on peach leaf Symptoms of bacterial spot on peach leaves Symptoms of bacterial spot on peach leaf Peach tree infected with bacterial spot Symptoms of bacterial spot on peach leaves Symptoms of bacterial spot on peach fruit Symptoms Water soaked, angular gray lesions on the underside of the leaves which turn purple and necrotic in the center and cause a shot hole appearance if lesion center drops out; if lesions are present in high numbers on leaves they may become chlorotic and drop from tree; cankers develop on twigs either as raised blisters or as a dark area surrounding a bud that fails to open; in years of severe infection the entire fruit crop may be lost; lesions on fruit begin as small brown, water- soaked lesions which may exude gum Cause Bacterium Comments Periods of frequent rainfall during late bloom and early petal drop increase likelihood of fruit and leaf infection; infection is rare during hot, dry weather Management Avoid planting susceptible peach varieties in areas where disease is known; once disease is visible it can be difficult to control, protective copper applications in the Fall prior to leaf drop and/or application in early growing season may help prevent the disease; care should be taken as peach trees are very sensitive to copper Crown gall Agrobacterium spp Galls on roots of peach tree Symptoms of crown gall on trunk of peach tree Galls on peach roots Crowm gall symptoms Gall on branch of peach tree Gall on peach tree Large gall on trunk of peach tree Symptoms of crown gall on trunk of peach tree Symptoms Galls on roots and/or crown of tree which can range in size from so small they are not visible to the naked eye up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter; galls first become visible as white, fleshy swellings that grow rapidly and become tan to brown in color; galls typically develop at the site of a wound and new galls form adjacent to old ones the next year Cause Bacterium Comments Infection with crown gall begins at the site of plant wounds; disease emergence is favored by poorly-drained, alkaline soils and previous feeding damage by nematodes Management Chemical control of the disease is generally ineffective; an effective bacterial biological control is available for commercial production; cultural control methods include: planting only certified, disease-free material, planting peach in well-draining soil, rotating infected fields with a non-host before peach is planted and also using good sanitation practices Scab Cladosporium carpophilum Scab symptoms on peach fruit Scab symptoms on peach fruit Scab symptoms on peach fruit Scab symptoms on peach twigs Scab symptoms on peach twig Scab on peach fruit Symptoms Small, green to olive circular spots on surface of fruit, usually close to stem end, which enlarge, darken and develop a green or yellow halo; lesions may coalesce and cause fruit surface to crack; lesions on infected green twigs are hardly visible to start off with but become brown with a raised border before turning purple or dark brown; infected leaves develop angular or circular lesions on the lower surface which are initially a similar color to the leaf but turn olive green as they mature; leaf lesions may coalesce to form chlorotic patches; defoliation may occur Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in in twig lesions or on bark surface Management Control currently relies completely on the use of fungicides; pruning the tree canopy promotes good air circulation and allows light to penetrate which can help control scab Category : Fungal Brown rot Monilinia fructicola Blighted blossoms Symptoms of brown rot on fruits Brown rot on fruit Symptoms of brown rot on peach twigs and blossoms Brown rot on fruit Symptoms of brown rot on peach blossom Symptoms Brown discoloration of fruit skin and inner tissue; fruit skin wrinkled; collapsed flowers exuding sap from their bases; tan cankers with dark edges on twigs; gray-brown spore masses may be present on cankers Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives in mummified fruit on the tree, blighted blossoms, cankers and infected twigs; blossom and twig blights are promoted by periods of wet weather Management The currently most effective method of controlling brown rot is through the application of appropriate protective fungicides timed so that they are applied when the susceptible flower parts are exposed or after a wet period; avoiding sprinkler irrigation protects the leaves and flowers from wetness that promotes the disease.
Cultural control methods include: removing mummified fruit from tree, pruning infected twigs and reducing plant stress by providing adequate levels of water and fertilizer Rust Tranzschelia discolor Rust symptoms on peach leaves Rust symptoms on peach leaves Rust spots on peach leaves Symptoms Pale yellow-green spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces which are angular in shape and turn bright yellow in color; spots on lower leaf surface develop orange-red spores Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in twigs or in leaves which remain attached to the tree Management Rust can be prevented by spraying trees with protective fungicides; application is usually carried out one, two and three months before harvest in areas prone to early season outbreaks of the disease and after harvest in areas where disease is less problematic or emerges later in the season Shot hole disease Wilsonomyces carpophilus Shot hiole symptoms on peach fruit Shot hole lesions on peach fruit Shot hole lesions on peach fruit Shot hole lesions on peach fruit Symptoms Brown lesions with purple edge on fruit, twigs and buds; holes in leaves due to lesions which have dried and dropped out; brown lumps developing in the center of lesion (visible with hand lens); buds turning brown or black and exuding sap; tan lesions with brown margins which exude sap on twigs Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors wet, windy conditions Management Application of Bordeaux mixture before rains in Fall are sufficient to protect dormant buds and twigs over winter Silver leaf disease Chondrosterum pupureum Symptoms Leaves have a silvery appearance; if infection is severe the leaves may curl upwards and become necrotic; death of individual limbs or entire tree may occur; fungal fruiting bodies appear on the surface of the dead bark Cause Fungus Comments Pathogen is spread via spores released after rainfall during periods of high humidity and can enter trees through pruning wounds; risk of infection is increased if tree is pruned during late winter or early spring; trees also susceptible when they are heavily pruned Management Control of silver leaf disease is difficult and infection can be widespread after rainfall in areas where the disease is present; strategies to reduce the incidence of the disease include: removing all plant debris e.g.
pruning waste, stumps, and logs; pruning tree during dry periods and treating large pruning wounds with fungicidal dressing Category : Viral Leaf curl Taphrina deformans Peach leaf curl symptoms Peach leaf curl symptoms Leaf curl on peach Peach leaf curl symptoms Peach leaf curl symptoms on foliage Peach leaf curl symptoms on young peach tree Peach leaf infected with leaf curl Symptoms Yellow to red patches on young leaves in Spring which thicken and pucker causing leaf to curl; puckered parts of leaf may develop white covering; infected leaves may drop from plant or remain attached and turn dark brown; infection of fruit is rare but causes irregular, raised and wrinkled red lesions Cause Fungus Comments Emergence of leaf curl is promoted by periods of cool, wet weather during the early stages of bud development Management The primary method of controlling peach leaf curl is the application of appropriate fungicides and/or planting resistant peach varieties; no peach varieties are completely resistant to leaf curl Plum pox virus Plum pox virus (PPV) Symptoms of plum pox on peach leaves Symptoms of plum pox on peach fruit Symptoms First expanding leaves exhibit chlorotic veinclearing and veinbanding; lamina twisted and distorted; fruit show dark rings, lines and spots; symptoms on fruti may disappear on ripening; fruit may be deformed Cause Virus Comments Virus is transmitted by aphids but most common method of spread is diseased plant material Management Plant certified healthy material; remove infected trees from orchard; chemical sprays to control aphids may prolong spread of virus Category : Oomycete Phytophthora root and crown rot Phytophthora spp.

The fruit is a pod with one to five seeds that develop underground within a needle-like structure called a peg. The leaves are arranged in alternate pairs and have leaf-like attachments near the stalk.The groundnut plant produces yellow, orange, cream, or white flowers which produce 'pegs', characteristic floral structures which sink into the ground to grow the pod.The pods can reach up to 10 cm (4 in) in length and can contain between 1 and 5 seeds.The plant can reach 0.6 m (2 ft) in height depending on the variety and as an annual plant, survives only one growing season.The seeds are rich in oil (38-50%), protein, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamins.Groundnuts also have considerable medicinal value.They are reported to be useful in the treatment of diseases such as hemophilia, stomatitis, and diarrhea.In sub-Saharan Africa, groundnuts are a basic staple crop, cultivated mainly by small-scale farmers both as subsistence and as a cash crop.
It is an important source of protein and other nutrients for poor rural communities. In Africa, groundnut yields are traditionally low, due to unreliable rains, little technology available to small-scale farmers, pest and disease occurrence, poor seed variety, and increased cultivation on marginal land (ICRISAT).Groundnuts may also be referred to as peanut, monkeynut, or earth nut.Groundnuts originated in South America from southern Bolivia to north-western Argentina.The Portuguese took them from Brazil to West Africa and then to southwestern India in the 16th century.Africa is now regarded as a secondary center of diversity.Peanut Processing Roasted, salted peanuts Groundnut Varieties in Kenya There are two main varieties of groundnuts in Kenya: Runner type Bunch type The runner is a large variety and it's highly preferred because of high yields, it matures in 90-100 days.Bunch varieties are small, tastier, and highly marketable, it matures in 60- 75 days.
Other varieties include Red Valencia, Red Oriata, Manipinta, Makulu Red, Bukene, Homa Bay, Texas Peanut, and Atika. Red Valencia: This variety is easy to grow and produces two to five kernels per long pod.Itâ€™s slightly smaller in size and has a sweeter taste with papery red seed covers.Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management Groundnuts are grown in most tropical, subtropical, and temperate countries between 40Â°N and 40Â°S latitude, especially in Africa, Asia, North, and South America.Â They are grown in the warm tropics and subtropics below 1500 m above sea level, and in temperate humid regions with sufficiently long warm summers.The optimum mean daily temperature to grow is 30Â°C and growth ceases at 15Â°C.Cool temperatures delay flowering.Groundnuts cannot stand frost.Between 500 and 600 mm of water reasonably well distributed through the growing season allows good production.
Groundnuts are drought-tolerant species and can withstand severe lack of water, but the yield is generally reduced. If harvesting conditions are wet, aflatoxins (severe poison produced by some fungi such as Aspergillus spp) may develop on the nuts.Aflatoxin contamination is a major hazard to human and animal health.When groundnuts are poorly dried and stored, they pick mold and dirt, which attracts fungi, that release aflatoxin chemicals that are dangerous to human health, especially the liver.Pods develop underground and must be recovered at harvest, therefore crumbly, well-drained soils are preferred, but plants grow and develop adequately on heavier clay soils.For optimum growth, soil pH should be in the range of 5.5 to 6.5, though Bunch types tolerate more acidic conditions (pH 4.5) and some cultivars grow well in alkaline soils up to pH 8.5.Uses Most commercially grown peanuts are used for the extraction of their oil which is used in cooking.
The by-product of oil extraction is a pressed cake which is used as animal feed and also in the production of peanut flour. Raw kernels are also commonly roasted and eaten as a snack food.The vegetative residues from the crop are excellent forage.Planting Procedure Peanut is usually propagated from seed.Seeds should be planted in a well-prepared seedbed in soil that is loose and crumbly with no large clumps.The seedbed should be free from weeds which will compete with the peanut seedlings.Weeds may be removed by hand cultivating or through the use of an appropriate herbicide.Peanut seeds should be planted by hand to a depth of 3â€“5 cm (1â€“2 in).It is best to ridge the soil or use flat beds as this will make harvesting the peanuts easier.After ploughing and harrowing to a fairly good tilth, ridges that are 80 cm apart with flattish tops, should be made so that two rows of nuts can be planted on each ridge.
Seeds for planting should be well selected: they should be clean, well- filled, and without any blemishes. Seeds should be kept in their pods and shelled a few days before planting.Planting depth is like maize about 5 to 8 cm.Seed rate is 40 to 50 kg/ha depending on the size of the seeds.Intercropping They can be grown as a sole crop and also intercropped with maize, soybean, and cassava.It is also a good intercrop for upland rice, sorghum, okra, sugarcane, and sunflower.In some areas, they are grown under perennial tree crops such as coconut, oil palm, or rubber.Groundnuts when used as intercrop for upland maize and planted along the contour reduce soil runoff.The plant also reduces the population of African bollworms because it serves as a hiding place for beneficial insects.There is an increase in the yield of groundnuts when intercropped with early-maturing pigeon peas.Husbandry To achieve maximum economic yields, weeds must be eliminated.
Groundnuts are poor competitors with weeds during the early stages of growth. Weeding should be done early while at the same time earthing up the ridges to encourage "pegging" i.e.young nuts penetration through the soil.Once pegging has started, only hand weeding should be undertaken to avoid disturbing the young nuts or damaging the flowers.Clean weeding should be done in up to 6 weeks after which hand weeding should take over.The only peculiar nutrient requirement is for calcium (Ca) in the podding zone.Calcium is absorbed directly by the pods if soil moisture is adequate.A shortage of Ca in that zone will result in empty pods (especially in Runner cultivars).The crop's needs for nitrogen should be satisfied with symbiotic fixation by strains of Rhizobium of the cowpea group, so nitrogen fertilizers are not generally required.In some areas of acid soils, lime is applied to raise the pH and supply Ca.
Moisture stress during flowering or pod filling reduces yield therefore irrigation is important during those periods to minimize or eliminate the stress, and increase production and seed quality. Where yields are unsatisfactory (heavily eroded soils) an application of 200 kg/ha of rock phosphate is recommended.Harvesting Bunch cultivars are harvested 85-100 days after sowing and Runner cultivars 110-130 days after sowing in the warm tropics.Dig a few plants up to see if the nuts are ready.The nuts should be brown on the outside, firm, and dry.Usually, at maturity the inside of the pods is grey and some rattling occurs when pods are shaken.Severe disease of foliage sometimes results in harvesting before seeds are fully mature.Plants should be carefully dug out to avoid nuts breaking off and remaining in the ground.Dry for 2-3 days, then rip the pods from the bushes and place them on mats to dry for another 7-10 days to about 10% moisture.Shelling should be done by hand.
Broken, dirty, or damaged nuts should be discarded as these will lower the quality and hence the selling price. When the groundnuts are poorly dried and stored, they pick mold and dirt, which attracts fungi, that release aflatoxin chemicals that are dangerous to human health, especially the liver.Nuts to be used as seeds the following year should not be shelled.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Arachis hypogaea (groundnut) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/6932.[Accessed 06 March 15].Paid subscription required .Duke, J.A.(1983).Arachis hypogaea L.Handbook of Energy Crops.unpublished.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Arachis_hypogaea.html#Ecology.[Accessed 06 March 15].Free to access .Kokalis-Burelle, N., Porter, D.M, RodrÃ​guez-KÃ¡bana, R., Smith, D.H.& Subrahmanyam, P.(Eds.)

Charcoal rot Macrophomina phaseolina Symptoms Water soaked lesions on stems of seedlings close to soil line; lesions girdle stem and kill seedlings; lesions in similar area may be present in older plants; lesions are initially water-soaked but turn brown; if lesions girdle the stem, plant wilts and branches die; infections beginning in the roots cause leaves to turn yellow and wilt and causes stems to be blighted. Cause Fugnus Comments Fungus survives in crop debris in the soil; disease emergence is favored by high soil temperatures which cause plants to be water stressed and more susceptible to disease; fungus can survive for prolonged periods in dry soils but are killed in wet soil.
Management Rotating crop with rice for a period of 3-4 years can reduce the level of oioculum in the soil; providing the plants with adequate irrigation and fertilization reduces susceptibility to the disease; there are currently no resistant varieties of peanut; frequent irrigation to wet soil reduces the incidence of the disease. Cylindrocladium black rot Cylindrocladium crotalariae Blackened and shriveled roots due to black rot infection Clusters of fungal fruiting bodies on peanut stem Rotting caused by Cylindrocladium black rot on peanut Plants yellowing and wilting Symptoms Leaves on main stem turning chlorotic and wilting; entire plant wilts very rapidly when there is a period of water stress following high moisture; clusters of red-brown fungal bodies occur on on stems, pegs and pods; roots destroyed; roots blackened and shriveled.
Cause Fungus Comments Crops planted early are more susceptible to the disease as they are often exposed to cooler temperatures and higher soil moisture; disease is seed transmitted and also can spread over long distances by wind. Management The most effective method to control the disease is to plant peanut varieties that have some resistance to the disease; rotation of crop with nonhost such as corn , cotton or tobacco may help to reduce inoculum in the soil; application of appropriate soil fumigants in heavily infested fields can help to control the disease.Early leaf spot Cercospora arachidicola Close-up image of an early leaf spot lesion on peanut Symptoms of early leaf spot on peanut leaves Symptoms Small chlorotic flecks on leaf petioles, stems and pegs which enlarge and turn dark in color; lesions on upper surface of leaves usually possess a yellow halo and are reddish brown on the underside of leaves.
Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by high humidity and warm temperatures; spread of the disease is promoted by pronlonged leaf wetness. Management If disease is present, a rotation away from peanut for a period of 2-3 years is advised but is insufficient to control the disease completely; peanut crop debris should be plowed into soil after harvest and any volunteers removed from the nonhost crop; fungicides should be applied with caution as they can exacerbate other foliar diseases where they are present.
Late leaf spot Cercospora personatum Severe defoliation in peanut field infected with Cercospora Peanut plant infected with Cercospora fungus Cercospora lesions on peanut Cercospora infected peanut leaves Peanut plant infected with Cercospora fungus Defoliation due to Cercospora infection Peanut plant infected with Cercospora fungus Symptoms Small chlorotic flecks on leaf petioles, stems and pegs which enlarge and turn dark in color; symptoms may be very similar or identical to early leaf spot and can only be differentiated by examination of conidia under a microscope. Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by high humidity and warm temperatures; spread of the disease is promoted by pronlonged leaf wetness.
Management If disease is present, a rotation away from peanut for a period of 2-3 years is advised but is insufficient to control the disease completely; peanut crop depris should be plowed into soil after harvest and any volunteers removed from the nonhost crop; fungicides should be applied with caution as they can exacerbate other foliar diseases where they are present. Phyllostica leaf spot Phyllostica arachidis-hypogaea Circular lesions with red-brown margins and light brown or tan centers on leaves Symptoms of Phyllostica leaf spot on peanut leaves Symptoms Circular lesions with red-brown margins and light brown or tan centers on leaves; centers of lesions may dry out and drop from leaf resulting in a "shot-hole" appearance.Cause Fungus Comments Phyllostica leaf spot is known to occur in the U.S., India, China, Argentina, Thailand, the Philippenes, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Niger and Burkino Faso.
Management Disease is held in check by fungicides applied to control early or late leaf spot. Rust Puccinia arachidis Rust symptoms on peanut Symptoms of rust on peanut leaves Rust symptoms on peanut Symptoms of rust on peanut leaves Rust symptoms on peanut Rust symptoms on peanut Symptoms of rust on peanut leaves Rust symptoms on peanut Symptoms of rust on peanut leaves Symptoms of rust on peanut leaves Symptoms Characteristic orange pustules on undersides of leaves which become covered in masses of red-brown spores; pustules may form on pods.Cause Fungus Comments Peanut rust is highly specific to peanut; disease emergence and spread is favored by warm temperatures followed by leaf wetness.
Management Allow field to fallow for at least one month between successive peanut plantings; remove any volunteer peanut plants during fallowing to reduce inoculum; sprays of appropriate fungicides such as Bordeaux mixture can effectively control the disease; such fungicides are often also effective at controlling leaf spot. Sclerotinia blight Sclerotinia minor Severe Sclerotinia blight on peanut Sclerotia of Sclerotinia minor inside peanut pod Early infection of Sclerotinia minor on peanut Stem shredding by Sclerotinia minor on peanut Hard black sclerotia on infected peanut stems Sclerotia, stem bleaching and shredding by Sclerotinia minor on peanut Symptoms Tips of infected branches wilt or flag rapidly; early signs of infection include the presence of small water-soaked lesions at the base of the stems which turn yellow or bleached; leaves on infected branches turn chlorotic and then wither; fluffy white fungal growth may appear on infected tissues during periods of high humidity.
Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive for prolonged periods in the soil, even in the absence of peanut; emergence of the disease in the peanut crop is favored by periods of cool weather, moist soil and high humidity. Management Plant seeds which are coated with protectants; avoid injuring plants with tools and/or machinery; application of appropriate fungicides can reduce crop losses when disease is present; avoid excessive irrigation during cool weather.Southern stem rot Sclerotium rolfsii Below-ground symptoms of southern stem rot.Dense white mycelial growth and brown sclerotia of Sclerotium rolfsii, causing southern stem rot of peanut White fungal mat developing on the stem close to the soil line Symptoms Lateral branches or main stem yellowing and wilting; white fungal mat developing on the stem close to the soil line; white to brown spore containing structures developing from the fungal mats.
Cause Fungus Comments Pathogen has a large host range and attacks many crops including sugar beets; disease favors dry soils which crack deeply, allowing the penetration of oxygen. Management Plow crop debris deeply into soil after harvest of crop; crop rotation of 3-4 years are very effective at reducing soil inoculum in the case of severe infestations; applications of appropriate fungicides can help suppress stem rot but care should be taken with selection as some pesticides (e.g.benomyl) are known to increase the severity of the the disease.Verticillium wilt Verticillium spp.Symptoms Chlorosis of leaf margins; curling leaves; loss of leaf turgor; plants wilt and become stunted as the disease progresses; plants wilt rapidly during periods of water stress; vascular system becomes dicolored.
Cause Fungi Comments Fungus can survive in the soil for several years; disease is spread to uninfested fields by movement of infested soil or contaminated tools and machinery; there are no peanut varieties known to have resistance to the disease. Management Irrigate plants frequently to reduce wilting of infected plants and allow them to reach maturity; eliminate weeds int he plantation which may allow inoculum to build up in the soil; remove and destroy infected crop residue after harvest to reduce inoculum in the field.Web blotch (Phoma leaf spot) Phoma arachidicola Web blotch infected leaves Symptoms Circular, brown-black lesions on the upper surfaces of the leave; web or net-like brown lesions on leaves may form on leaves during periods of high humidity; as sisease progresses, lesions darken and develop a rough texture; lesions may cover entire leaf surface.Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by cool, moist conditions and periods of prolonged leaf wetness.
Management Remove and destroy infested crop debris to prevent build up of inoculum in soil; rotate crops away from peanut; foliar fungicide applications are largely ineffective if conditions are favorable for the disease. Category : Viral Stunt Peanut stunt virus (PSV) Peanut stunt virus infected leaf Symptoms of peanut stunt virus on peanut leaves Symptoms on leaves Peanut stunt virus infected plants Symptoms Leaves curled and pale yellow to green; leaf petioles shortened; plants growth severely stunted; plants may produce very few pods if they have been infected early in the growing season.Cause Virus Comments PSV is transmitted by aphids; legumes such as white clover are the primary source of inoculum.Management Avoid planting peanut in close proximity to legumes such as clover; remove any infected plants from plantation to reduce inoculum.
Tomato spotted wilt virus & Peanut bud necrosis Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) Peanut bud necrosis virus (PBNV) Groundnut bud necrosis disease symptoms:mild chlorotic mottle or specks on young, quadrifoliate leaves, which develop into chlorotic and necrotic rings and streaks (left). Necrosis of the terminal bud (right) Stunted plant with small, darkened pods due to tomato spotted wilt virus Tomato spotted wilt virus symptoms Twisted terminal with mottled leaflets ue to tomato spotted wilt virus Symptoms of tomato spotted wilt virus Tomato spotted wilt virus infected plants Symptoms Chlorotic spots or mottled patterns on leaves; drooping leaflets during hot weather; necrosis of terminal buds; stunted growth; new leaflets are reduced in size and may be puckered with mosaic mottling.Cause Virus Comments Both viruses have an extremely wide host range and are transmitted by thrips vectors.
Management Use high quality seed and use adequate plant spacings to avoid overcrowding; provide plants with adequate irrigation and fertilization to encourage the fast establishment of seedlings and growth of a close canopy which is unattractive to thrips vectors; intercropping peanut with sorghum or millet can reduce disease incidence. Pests Category : Insects Armyworms Spodoptera spp.
Death of armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larva due to external parasitoid (biological control) Southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania) larva Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) eggs Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) adult Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) larva Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larva feeding on leaves Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) adult Yellowstriped armyworm (Spodoptera ornithogalli) larva feeding on leaves Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside.
Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year. Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae.Thrips (Tobacco thrips) Frankliniella fusca Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips palmi Thrips damage to young peanut plant Thrips damage to peanut Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color.Cause Insect Comments Thrips transmit viruses to plants, including Tomato spotted wilt virus and Peanut bud necrosis virus.
Management use adequate plant spacings to avoid overcrowding; provide plants with adequate irrigation and fertilization to encourage the fast establishment of seedlings and growth of a close canopy which is unattractive to thrips vectors. Velvetbean Caterpillar Anticarsia gemmatalis Velvetbean caterpillar Adult Green form of a velvetbean caterpillar feeding on peanut leaves Velvetbean caterpillar Adult on peanut plant Dark form of a velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Dark form of velvetbean caterpillar feeding on peanut leaves.Symptoms The larva causes damage to plant by feeding on leaves.The larva after hatching from egg starts feeding on leaves The first and second stage larva skeletonise the leaves by feeding only on soft parts.The later stage laraves consumes entire leaves.They will stripe the field just in four to seven days.The larvae may also feeds on tender stem, buds and pods.
Cause Insect Comments Velvetbean caterpillars feeds on legume (like soybean, kudzu, velvetbean, horse beans, cowpea), cotton and several weeds. Generally moths lay eggs in mass under leaf surface.Management Encourage natural predators and parasites in the field; early or late planting of crops helps in escaping the insect attack; grow available resistant varieties; spray biocontrol agents like nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) and the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).If the incidence is severe spray suitable insecticide.Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp Galls on root due to Root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne arenaria.Galls on peanut roots Root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne arenaria, on peanut showing severe galling.Symptoms Galls on roots which can be up to 3.3 cm (1 in) in diameter but are usually smaller; reduction in plant vigor; yellowing plants which wilt in hot weather.
Cause Nematode Comments Galls can appear as quickly as a month prior to planting; nematodes prefer sandy soils and damage in areas of field or garden with this type of soil is most likely. Management Plant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil ;check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes; solarizing soil can reduce nematode populations in the soil and levels of inoculum of many other pathogens.Category : Mites Two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Spider mite damaged leaves Spider mite damaged leaves Spider mites infestation Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant.
Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack. Management Spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction.About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description The European pear, Pyrus communis , is a perennial deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae, grown for its fruit.
The tree is a short deciduous tree with a tall and narrow crown and alternately arranged, simple leaves. The leaves are elliptical with finely serrated margins and defined tips and can reach 2â€“12 cm (0.7â€“4.7 in) in length.The tree produces white flowers which are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter and a fleshy green pyriform fruit.Pear trees can reach 9 m (30ft) and will produce fruit for about 20 years .The European pear may be referred to by name of its cultivars which include the Bartlett, d'Anjou, Kaiser Alexander and Comice pears.The European pear occurs only as cultivated trees and does not grow wild in nature.It is descendant of wild European and Asian pear trees.Young pears Pear buds Pear blossoms Pear trees in blossom Pear blossoms Pear fruits Uses The pear fruit is eaten fresh or can be cooked in a range of sweet dishes.The fruit may also be pressed for juice.The leaves of the tree can be used to produce dyes and the wood can be used in carpentry and is very durable.
Pear Content Propagation Basic requirements Pears grow very well in areas that have a late frost and a cool, dry summer and will grow at temperatures between -26 and 45Â°C (-14.8â€“133Â°F). Pear trees have a chilling requirement of between 1000 and 1500 hours between 0 and 7Â°C (32â€“44.6Â°F) to break dormancy depending on the particular variety being grown.Generally, trees must cross pollinate with a different variety in order to successfully set fruit.Pear trees require a deep, well draining soil with a pH of 6â€“7 and will grow in sandy, medium or heavy soil.Pear trees are the most tolerant of all fruit trees of wet soils but roots should not be waterlogged for more than a few days at a time.Propagation Pear trees are propagated by budding onto suitable rootstocks.Rootstocks are usually also pear but quince is also used in warmer growing regions.Pear trees are usually acquired from the nursery as bare-rooted seedlings.
They are planted by digging a whole which is large enough to accommodate the outstretched roots of the tree without bending. The graft union should be at least 10â€“15 cm (4â€“6 in) above the soil line.Trees should be spaced 4.8 m (16 ft) apart, leaving 7.5 m (25 ft) between rows.The best time for planting is in early Spring or Fall while the trees are still dormant.Young trees are susceptible to wind damage and should be provided with a wind break.Training and pruning Pear trees are usually trained in the same way is apple trees and often they follow a central leader system.The central leader system encourages earlier fruiting and is recommended for European pear varieties.The system consists of one main trunk which gives rise to 12 t0 16 primary scaffold branches.The tree becomes conical in shape, being wider at the bottom and narrower at the top.The shape is achieved through selective pruning of the branches in the years after planting.
At time of planting, the tree is headed back by cutting the leader at a height of approximately 90 cm (36 in) from the ground. All branched lower than 76 cm (30 in) from the ground should also be removed at this time alongside and damaged or broken branches and those with narrow crotch angles.In the first winter following planting, the longest, most vigorous, vertical shoot should be selected as the leader and other vigorous shoots with narrow crotch angles removed.Branches with wide crotch angles (>40Â°) can be left on the tree and corrected with spacers (lengths of wire secured around the branch to correct the growth angle).Each year, while the tree is dormant, the central leader should be headed back by about 1/3 of its length and any vigorous, competing branches with narrow crotch angles removed.After the tree has fruited for two years, some branches will need removed to open up the canopy.
General care and maintenance The amount of fertilizer that should be supplied to pear trees depends on the soil type and composition and should be checked with the aid of a soil test. Less nitrogen is supplied to pear trees than to apple as it promotes vigorous growth, increasing susceptibility to fire blight.in the first year of growth, phosphorous and potassium may be required but in subsequent years, only nitrogen is generally added to the soil.The area around the base of the pear tree should be kept free from weeds which compete for water and nutrients.In commercial plantations, appropriate herbicides may be used for weed control.In the home garden, weeds can be removed by hand.Pear trees may require fruit to be thinned to prevent over production which can lead to reduced yields in subsequent years or cause damage to the tree through excess weight.fruits should be thinned early in the season to a final density of approximately 1 fruit every 15 cm (6 in).
Harvesting Pear fruits are usually harvested when mature, but are are ripened off of the tree. Pear allowed to ripen on the tree tend to ripen from the core outwards, resulting in fruit with mushy centers.It can be difficult to determine the correct time to harvest pears and so a variety of factors should be taken into consideration prior to picking.One of the most common indicators of maturity is the firmness of the fruit.Commercial plantations use devices called penetrometers to determine fruit firmness.Pears should be harvested when the reading is between 16 and 19 pounds.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Pyrus communis (European pear) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/46190.[Accessed 25 March 15].Paid subscription required .Lord, W.G.& Ouellette, A.(2013).Growing pears in the home garden.University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/Resource000587_Rep609.pdf.[Accessed 25 March 15].

Description Pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum , is an annual grass in the family Poaceae which is grown widely in Africa and India for its grain which can be used to make flour and other foodstuffs. Pearl millet is a very robust grass which tillers widely and grows in tufts.It has slender stems which are divided into distinct nodes.The leaves of the plant are linear or lance-like, possess small teeth and can grow up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in length.The inflorescence of the plant is a spike-like panicle, made up of many smaller spikelets where the grain is produced.Pearl millet can reach 0.5 to 4 m (1.6â€“13.1 ft) in height depending on the cultivar and is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season.Pearl millet may also be referred to as bulrush millet, cat-tail millet or yellow bristle grass and originates from the Sahel zone of Africa.Synonyms are P.americanum (L.) Leeke, and P.typhoides (Burm.) Stapf.
& Hubb.) And common names include bullrush millet, cat-tail- millet, mil-a-chandelle, bajra, kambu, duhkn. Pearl millet spike Pearl millet spikes Pearl millet field, India Pearl millet spikes Pearl millet spike Pearl millet Pearl Millet Content Field of pearl millet Uses Pearl millet grain can be ground into flour and used to produce porridge, or a type of flat bread.It can also be cooked and prepared in a manner similar to couscous or rice.The plant stems can be used for roof thatch and building construction.In countries other than Africa and India it is most widely grown as fodder.Propagation Basic requirements Pearl millet is adapted for growth in dry conditions where there is low rainfall.It is a warm season crop which will produce tillers at temperatures of 21â€“24Â°C (69.8â€“75.2Â°F) and develop spikelets at the slightly higher temperature of 25Â°C (77Â°F).
Pearl millet is tolerant of a variety of soils, including acidic and sandy soils and those which are nutrient poor but it will not tolerate waterlogging. The plants will grow optimally in a well-draining, fertile soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.Propagation Pearl millet is propagated directly from seed.Pearl millet seed is usually sown directly on fields on hills or ridges with short lived cultivars being planted as soon as possible after the wet season in semi-tropical regions.A well-prepared seedbed is important to ensure rapid development of seedlings.Pearl millet seeds are best sown when the soil has warmed to at least 20Â°C (68Â°F).Seed can be sown in furrows if the soil is light or if the plant is being grown in drier areas, or by broadcasting.Seeding rates vary from 12â€“15 lb of seed per acre when using a seed drill, to 30â€“40 lb per acre when seed is broadcast.A distance of 45â€“60 cm (17.7â€“23.6 in) is usually allowed between rows.
General care and maintenance Pearl millet is a fast growing crop that will quickly be able to outcompete weeds. It is, however, important to maintain a weed-free seed-bed as young seedlings are susceptible to competition.Traditional cultivation of pearl millet in Africa relies on rainfall to irrigate the plants and involves the application of little to no nitrogen fertilizers.The reason for this is often the application of nitrogen promoted vigorous early growth that can result in the plants using up water required at later stages of growth.In more temperate regions where pearl millet is grown as a forage crop, fertilizer application should be based on the results of a soil test.Harvesting Pearl millet reaches maturity between 50 and 180 days after planting, depending on the variety.The crop is harvested by hand either by cutting the spikes from the plant or by cuting the whole plant.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Pennisetum glaucum (pearl millet) datasheet.

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Cercospora leaf spot Cercospora penniseti Symptoms Small dark lesions on leaves which are usually oval in shape but may be oblong to rectangular; centers of lesions are gray to tan in color with visible black dots; lesions may be covered in spores during wet weather; lesions may also be present on the stems and are slightly longer than those on the leaves.Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence occurs when high temperatures coincide with periods of high humidity.
Management Avoid planting millet varieties that are highly susceptible to Cercospora fungi; control weeds in field; rotate crops and practice good sanitation; no chemical control is needed to treat the disease. Ergot Claviceps fusiformis Ergot infected spike on left Pearl millet Ergot Symptoms Ergot is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences).The first sign of ergot infection in pearl millet is the appearance of viscous creamy-pink exudations, called honeydew on the flowering heads.Subsequently hard brown spiky structures are formed, called sclerotia.Cause Fungus Comments Ergot reduces grain yields and constitutes a health hazard to humans and animals that consume pearl millet products contaminated with the alkaloid-containing sclerotia of the causal fungus.It is a particularly serious disease of pearl millet F1 hybrids.Biology and Epidemiology: Infection of the individual florets on a pearl millet inflorescence occurs via the stigmas, i.e.
the white feathery structures through which the florets are fertilised following pollination. Initial infection is from spores (ascospores) produced from sclerotia in the soil or in crop debris.Secondary infection is from the spores (conidia) produced in the honeydew.Once the stigmas have been pollinated they rapidly wither and are no longer available as the infection route for the ergot fungus.Pearl millet plants are protogynous, with the stigmas emerging before the anthers.Pearl millet F1 hybrids demonstrate synchronous flowering, so that most of the inflorescences in a crop will be at the protogynous stage with little or no pollen available, which makes F1 hybrids particularly vulnerable to ergot infection.Heavy rain at flowering time washes down pollen, extending the period at which the stigmas are available for infection as well as providing ideal conditions for germination and sporulation of the ergot fungus.
Management Management Ergot can be managed in pearl millet, through the use of host plant resistance, pollen management, avoidance and sanitation. Host plant resistance to ergot can be developed using appropriate inoculation, hybridisation and selection techniques.Sources of host plant resistance are developed and made available by public- and private-sector seed companies.It has been shown in research station experiments that using pollen donor plants to coincide with the protogynous stage of crop flowering can significantly reduce infection in ergot susceptible pearl millet F1 hybrids.Avoidance of ergot is achieved through the selection of cultivars that flower during periods of fine dry weather, so that pollen wash and pathogen germination are minimised.Sanitation measures involve the removal and burning of infected inflorescences as soon ergot symptoms are seen.When this is done at the honeydew stage it will reduce secondary spread within the crop.
When done at the sclerotial stage it will reduce the inoculum bank for infections in subsequent seasons and reduce the dangers of consumption of the the poisonous alkaloids getting into food and feed products. Pearl Millet Downy Mildew Sclerospora graminicola Downy mildew infection process Underside of leaf of infected plant showing sporangiospores and sporangia Indian Pearl Millet Green Ear symptoms caused by Downy Mildew in Pearl Millet Downy mildew on Pearl Millet Healthy Pearl Millet and downy mildew infected green ear with no usable grain Seed treatment plot Epidemiology of downy mildew in pearl millet Symptoms The earliest symptoms are chlorosis at the base of a leaf, with subsequent leaves on the plant becoming more and more chlorotic, with the chlorosis always extending from the bases towards the tips of the leaves.The underside of chlorotic leaves develop white powdery or downy growth of sporangia and the spores that they bear.
There is a distinct margin between diseased leaf tissue at base of leaf and healthy tissue towards tip. Inflorescences of infected tillers develop the characteristic green-ear symptoms where the grain is replaced by whip-like vegetative structures.Inflorescences can be partially or fully converted to green-ear, depending on the time in inflorescence development at which the infection occurred.Partial green-ear always begins at the base of the inflorescence.Plants infected at an early stage of development, before tillering begins can be killed.Cause Oomycete Comments Serious disease in Africa and India, occurs wherever millet is grown.Management The disease is systemic with the pathogen infecting the growing point of each tiller as the leaf and panicle tissues are being formed.Primary infection is from oospores which are long-lived in the soil.Secondary infection is from the spores produced by the sporangia on the undersides of infected leaves.
Oospores are formed in necrotic infected plant material, which then contribute to the inoculum bank in the soil. To reduce infection rogue infected plants when found in the field; treat seeds with an appropriate systemic fungicide prior to planting and continue to spray the crop at least once every 25 days after sowing.Seed treatment Pearl millet downy mildew can be effectively controlled through the use of metalaxyl-based fungicide seed treatments.Application rates as low as 2 g a.i.per kg seed, using specially formulated seed-treatment products, can provide complete control of downy mildew even with highly susceptible hybrids.There is no value of subsequent foliar fungicide sprays following effective seed treatment.
On-farm sanitation and selection In situations where resistant cultivars and seed treatments are not available, farming communities can reduce the incidence of downy mildew in pearl millet by on-farm sanitation practices and the selection of seed from robust downy mildew-free plants. Secondary spread of downy mildew within a crop is caused by the spores produced on diseased leaves, so removal of diseased plants or tillers at the first sign of disease should minimise secondary spread.Removal of diseased plants prior to inflorescence emergence, combined with selection of seed for the next seasonâ€™s sowing from robust, downy mildew-free plants, should also reduce the level of susceptibility in the local cultivar gene pool developing a population of locally DM-resistant cultivars.Sanitation and selection will be more effective if done on a community basis rather than by individual farmers acting alone.
The basis for effective on-farm actions is for farmers to fully understand the cause and epidemiology of the disease. Host Plant Resistance Pearl millet downy mildew is best managed by the use of resistant cultivars.Much has been learnt and done in the last 30 years to identify and utilise host plant resistance to this disease, through research done by ICRISAT in collaboration with National Agricultural Research Services (NARS) in India and other countries.In India, the existence of a strong and effective national agricultural research system together with effective public- and private-sector seed companies, has enabled the development and dissemination of a succession of cultivars and hybrids that have a high degree of resistance to downy mildew.The pathogen, however, is variable in its pathogenicity, so that cultivars or hybrids resistant to downy mildew in one region may not be resistant elsewhere.
The greatest range of pathogenicity occurs in the Sahel zone of Africa, where the host and pathogen have co-evolved over a long period. Pearl millet hybrids developed for resistance to downy mildew in India have been highly susceptible when grown in the Sahel.Through the ICRISAT-NARS cooperative International Pearl Millet Downy Mildew Nursery program, sources of resistance have been identified that are effective throughout India and right across the African Sahel.Rust Puccinia substriata Typical rust symptoms Symptoms Small yellow or white raised spots on upper and lower leaf surfaces; spots tend to be more numerous on lower leaf surface; spots enlarge and develop into red-brown pustules which may be surrounded by a yellow halo.Cause Fungus Comments Spores can be spread via wind and survive in crop debris in the soil.
Management Plant resistant varieties of millet if rust is a persistent problem; avoid the use of overhead irrigation; do now plant millet in close proximity to eggplant or other Solanaceous crops; there are no recommended chemical controls for rust. Smut Tolyposporium penicillariae Bref.Sori turning dark brown or black as they mature Infected florets develop as plump green sacs or sori Symptoms Smut is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences) that can significantly reduce grain yields, wherever the crop is grown.Infected florets develop as plump sacs or sori, initially green in colour and then turning dark brown or black as the sori mature.The sori are filled with black spores of the causal fungus, hence the name smut.Cause Fungus Comments Biology and epidemiology: Individual florets are infected by air-borne spores of the causal fungus when the inflorescences are at the protogynous stage.i.e.when the stigmas have emerged before pollination has occurred.
Mature spores released from the sori when the crop is threshed are mixed with seed from non-infected florets, and these are the source of infection for the subsequent crop.

Cause Weed Comments Biology & Epidemiology: Seeds of this parasitic plant remain dormant in the soil until exudates from roots of pearl millet plants (and other host species) stimulate their germination. Germ-tubes then invade the pearl millet roots, establishing a pathway for the extraction of moisture and nutrients from the pearl millet plant to enable the witchweed plants to develop and produce a crop of purple flowers.The flowers produce seed which add to the seed bank in the soil for parasitism of future crops.Management The most effective management would be achieved by the use of host-plant resistance.
In situations where there are no witchweed-resistant cultivars available, farming communities can reduce the levels of damage to the crop by: a) hand- pulling the witchweed plants as soon as they are visible, thereby reducing the loss of nutrients and moisture by the crop plants and preventing the addition of more witchweed seeds to the seed bank in the soil; b) the use of â€œtrapâ€​ or â€œdecoyâ€​ crops such as cowpea or soybean, possibly as an intercrop, which can stimulate germination of the witchweed seeds but are not parasitised, thus reducing the seed bank available for the pearl millet crop. In addition there are reports of control of witchweed by treating crop seeds with chemicals that prevent the germinating witchweed seeds from parasitising the crop plants.Where such seed treatments have been shown to be effective, are approved for use and are within the economic capabilities of the cultivator, they could be used as part of an integrated management program.
Farming communities can also attempt to develop locally-effective resistant varieties by selection of seed from plants that appear to have not been parasitised. A combination of effective locally-available management methods is recommended in an integrated management program.Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Pecan, Carya illinoinensis , is a large deciduous tree in the family Juglandaceae grown for its edible seeds (nuts).The pecan tree has a thick gray-brown trunk which can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter and a rounded canopy that spreads .The bark is ridged and has a scaly appearance.The twigs of the tree are red-brown in color and the foliage is dark green.
The leaves are pinnately divided and composed of 9â€“17 oblong-lanceolate leaflets. Each leaflet has as serrated margin and a downward curving tip.The tree produces separate male and female catkins with the male producing pollen and the female developing into the fruit.The male catkin is slender and pendulous, measuring 22â€“50 cm (8.7â€“19.7 in) in length and the female catkins are much smaller and possess 3â€“6 flowers in a cluster.The fruit is an ovalâ€“oblong drupe containing a single seed surrounded by a thin shell.The outer husk (shuck) is green, turning brown-black when mature at which point it also splits open to release the nut.The edible kernel of the nut is light brown in color and ridged longitudinally.Pecan trees can reach a height of 40â€“50 m (131â€“164 ft) and can live for several hundred years in a wild state.Commercial trees usually have an economic lifespan of approximately 25 years.Pecan originates from the North America, specifically, the South.
Pecan Pecan tree Pecan inflorescence Pecan husks Pecan inflorescence Pecan fruits on the tree Pecan Content Uses Pecan nuts are consumed fresh or after roasting as a snack food or may be used as an ingredient in baked goods or confection Propagation Basic requirements Pecan trees have a high water requirement and within their native range they are found growing in deep soils where their extensive roots can reach the water table or along river banks or streams. Pecan trees thrive in areas with long hot summers and cool winters.Trees can be grown in a range of soils but will grow optimally in a deep, well draining clay loam or sandy loam with a pH 6.0â€“7.5.Growing multiple pecan trees requires a great deal of space as the trees can reach a very large size.Propagation Pecan trees can be propagated from nuts or by budding or grafting.Nuts for propagation should be collected in the Fall from trees which gave good fill.The seeds require stratification prior to planting.
Stratification is the name given to a cold treatment which breaks the dormancy of the seed, speeding the germination process. Nuts are stratified at 2â€“5Â°C (35.6â€“41Â°F) for a period of 3- to 90 days and then incubated at room temperature.Nuts should be soaked in water for 24 hours prior to the treatment and kept moist throughout by mixing the nuts on moist vermiculite.The nuts can be planted outdoors in late winter if they are planted in place.if growing the seedlings in containers it is best to wait to plant until all threat of frost has passed.Seedling or grafted trees should be planted in full sun to part shade although trees are sensitive to shading and care should be exercised to ensure that the trees are not too shaded.Trees should be spaced 9â€“10 m (30â€“35 ft) apart General care and maintenance Newly planted trees must be supplied with adequate moisture to meet their growing requirements in the first few years following planting.
Trees must be supplied with 10 to 15 gallons of water weekly. This water can come from rainfall, irrigation, or a combination of both.Fertilization rates should ideally be based on the results of a soil test prior to planting but generally, 4 lbs of a complete fertilizer should be applied in a circular area around the base of the tree measuring 25 square feet.Fertilizer should never be placed directly in the planting hole as it can cause damage to the tree roots.A subsequent similar application in the summer should be enough to meet the growth requirements of the tree.The following year, apply 4 lbs of complete fertilizer per inch of tree diameter.Fertilizer should not be placed within 30.5 cm (12 in) of the trees trunk.Harvesting Pecans should be harvested as soon as the nuts have reached maturity, when the shuck has lost its green color and has started to split.in commercial plantations, hydraulic shakers may be used to dislodge the nuts from the tree.References Anderson, P.C.

a crystalline substance may be present on the surface of the lesion; infected leaves dry out by late summer and drop from the tree prematurely; defoliation may be severe Cause Fungus Comments Disease can develop rapidly after wet periods in the summer months and symptoms are worse in low-lying orchards Management The disease can be controlled by application of appropriate fungicides Category : Bacterial Bacterial leaf scorch Xylella fastidiosa Bacterial leaf scorch symptoms on pecan Bacterial leaf scorch symptoms on pecan Bacterial leaf scorch symptoms on pecan Bacterial leaf scorch symptoms on pecan Bacterial leaf scorch symptoms on pecan Bacterial leaf scorch symptoms on pecan Symptoms Tan to brown necrotic lesions with distinct dark brown line separating the diseased tissue from healthy; lesions occur on leaf margin or apex; entire leaves becoming necrotic; leaflets may drop from tree; symptoms may be confined to one limb or scattered throughout canopy Cause Bacterium Comments Vector of pathogen unknown, likely spread by xylem feeding insects Management Control of the disease should focus on limiting stress to the trees by providing adequate irrigation, thinning trees and controlling damaging insects Crown gall Agrobacterium tumefaciens Symptoms Galls of various sizes on roots and root crown below the soil line; galls may occasionally grow on the trunk; galls are initially light colored bulges which grow larger and darken; galls may be soft and spongy or hard; if galling is severe and girdles the trunk then young trees are weakened due to constricted vascular tissue; trees may be stunted and rarely die Cause Bacterium Comments The bacterium enters host plants through wounds and causes plant cells to proliferate and cells to be undifferentiated, leading to the formation of a gall Management Only plant disease-free nursery stock; plant trees in well-draining soils; avoid wounding the plants as much as possible; fresh wounds can be treated with a biocontrol agent ( Agrobacterium tumefaciens K84), if available, to prevent the bacterium colonizing Scab Cladosporium caryigenum Close-up image of scab lesions on pecan foliage Scab symptoms on pecan shucks Scab symptoms on pecan shucks Scab lesions on pecan foliage Scab symptoms on pecan shucks Scab lesions on pecan foliage Symptoms Small, rough or velvety olive green to black spots on leaves, green twigs or fruit; lesions may coalesce to form large dark areas with an irregular shape; leaflets may drop from plant if they are infected at the base of the petiole; lesions on young leaves may dry out and crack, resulting in a "shot hole" appearance as the leaves expand; lesions on shucks are virtually identical to those on the leaves ; severe infection of fruit can cause fruit to stop developing Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters in tissues infected previous year Management Scab is usually controlled by a series of fungicide sprays between budbreak and shell hardening Category : Oomycete Shuck and kernel rot Phytophthora cactorum Symptoms Rotting fruit with rot starting at stem end of fruit; dark brown rot with light brown margin spreading to cover entire fruit; kernels have a dark seed coat and bitter taste Cause Oomycete Comments Disease outbreaks sporadic but can be very damaging Management Appropriate fungicides should be applied at first sign of infection to reduce the severity of the infection; cultural control methods include thinning the canopy to promote good air circulation around the foliage and planting pecan in well- draining soils Pests Category : Insects Black pecan aphid Melanocallis caryaefoliae Adult winged black pecan aphid Feeding damage on pecan leaflet caused by black pecan aphid Lesions on pecan leaflet caused by clack pecan aphid Black pecan aphids and damage on pecan leaflet Symptoms Bright yellow angular spots on leaves between veins; the spots turn brown and, if there are a few present on the leaflet; the leaflet will drop from the tree; premature dropping of leaves causes reduced nut yields; insect is small and soft bodied and ranges in color from various shades of green to black; nymphs are usually lighter in color than the adults Cause Insect Comments The characteristic stickiness of plants which is usually present during aphid infestation cannot be used as an indicator of black pecan aphid attack as this aphid does not produce honeydew Management Trees should be inspected for aphids regularly due to their potential to cause severe damage; an appropriate insecticide which does not harm beneficial insects should be applied to reduce the aphid population Pecan nut casebearer Acrobasis nuxvorella Damage to pecan nutlets by pecan nut casebearer Damage to pecan nutlets by pecan nut casebearer Symptoms Holes in nutlets at base which usually is associated with black frass that protrudes from the hole; frass and damaged nutlets are held together by silken thread; adult insect is a small, light gray moth; larvae are initially white with a brown head and mature to olive or jade green Cause Insect Comments Larvae pupate to adult moths within the nut; insect overwinters as larva and may undergo several generations per year with the total number determined by location Management The primary method of controlling the pecan nut casebearer is through the application of an appropriate insecticide; insect growth regulators are preferable to organophosphates, carbamates or pyrethroids which disrupt populations of beneficial insects; Bacillus thurengiensis can also be an effective method of controlling the moth larvae but application must be timed well in order to be effective Pecan weevil Curculio caryae Symptoms Adult feeding on nuts prior to nut hardening causes nuts to drop from the tree;

larvae feed inside the nuts and can completely destroy the kernels; there are often little outward symptoms of larval feeding; shucks may remain attached to the nut shell; adult insect is a light brown-gray beetle with long snout; larvae are creamy white grubs wit brown heads Cause Insect Comments Trees should be monitored closely for signs of weevil infestation, particularly in dry years or if trees have a history of weevil infestation Management Pecan weevils can be controlled through the use of traps (there are several commercially available traps for pecan weevils) or by wrapping sticky bands around the tree trunk to prevent adult weevils climbing the trees, About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Bell peppers, Capsicum annuum are a cultivar group of annual or perennial plants in the family Solanaceae grown for their edible fruits.
Bell pepper plants are short bushes with woody stems that grow brightly colored fruits. The alternating leaves are elliptical, smooth edged, and come to a distinct point.The plant produces white or purple bell- shaped flowers which are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter.Red, yellow, purple, or brown fruit are produced each season about 3- 6 weeks after flowering.Pepper plants can grow 1 m (3.3 ft) tall and are usually grown as annuals in temperate regions for only one growing season.Bell pepper may be referred to as red pepper, yellow pepper or green pepper and is believed to have originated in Central and South America.Purple bell pepper Pepper foliage and fruit Bell pepper blossom Bell pepper ripening from green to red Bell pepper plant Green bell peppers Uses Bell peppers can be eaten fresh as a salad vegetable, or cooked in a variety of dishes.
Pepper, bell Content Propagation Basic requirements Bell peppers are warm-season crops and grow best at temperatures between 18 and 30Â°C (65â€“86Â°F). They can be grown in many soil types although sandy soils warm faster in Spring and are good for early planting.The soil should have a pH between 6 and 7.Peppers will not tolerate water saturated soil and should be planted in a well draining soil or raised bed.Peppers should be planted in an area that receives full sun for most of the day.Sowing seeds In most cases, pepper seeds should be started indoors 8â€“10 weeks before the last Spring frost.Pepper should only be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season, otherwise seeds should be sown indoors in flats or cell trays using a sterile seedling mix.Plant seeds to a depth of 1.3 cm (1/2 in) and water lightly.
Seeds should not be allowed to dry out as there will be a negative impact on germination rates.Trays should be positioned in a warm, bright, South facing window or under fluorescent lighting. The optimum soil temperature for germination is 21â€“29Â°C(70â€“85Â°F).A heat mat can be used to warm the flats if required.Seedlings will emerge within 8â€“25 days and after the seedlings has developed two sets of true leaves then they can be moved to a larger (3-4 in) pot.Seedlings should be provided with ample light and adequate fertilizer.Transplanting Peppers are usually transplanted 2â€“3 weeks after the last frost when the soil temperature has reached a minimum of 15.5Â°C (60Â°F).Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting.
Beginning approximately 7â€“10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The hardening off process is very important as peppers are very susceptible to transplant shock.The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth.When transplanting seedlings, allow 30â€“45 cm (12â€“18 in) between plants and 60â€“76 cm (24â€“30 in) between rows.Side dress plants with a nitrogen fertilizer at planting.Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist.Mulching around the plants can also help to conserve soil moisture.General care and maintenance Peppers will benefit from applications of fertilizer to keep them supplied with essential nutrients.A timed release fertilizer can be applied at bloom or the plants can be fed with a liquid fertilizer at planting and every two weeks thereafter.
In addition, pepper plants can produce a heavy load of fruit and it can be helpful to provide the plants with some support using stakes or cages to prevent branches from breaking under the weight. Use a soft material to tie plants to stakes or cages.Pepper plant in tomato cage Pepper plants in cages in raised bed Pepper seedlings potted into larger pots Pepper seedlings in cell trays References Drost, D.(2010).Peppers in the garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HG_Garden_2005-12.pdf.[Accessed 27 March 15].Free to access .Pernezny, K.L., Roberts, P.D., Murphy, J.F.& Goldberg, N.P.(Eds.)

Anthracnose lesions on pepper fruit - note concentric patternation Anthracnose lesions on pepper fruit Large anthracnose lesion on pepper fruit Anthracnose lesion on pepper fruit Symptoms Circular lesions on fruit which contain tan to orange to black concentric rings in the center; lesions usually reach 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter but may enlarge to cover most of the fruit surface; lesions may also occur on leaves and stems and appear as irregularly shaped gray spots with dark margins Cause Fungi Comments Anthracnose is found in all major vegetable growing areas worldwide and can cause large losses if left untreated Management Always plant disease-free seeds and transplants; seeds can be freed from infection by treating with hot water at 52Â°C (125.6Â°F) for 30 minutes; if disease is known to present, the field should be rotated with non-susceptible crops for a period of 3 years; plowing crop residue deeply into the soil r removing crop debris can help to reduce inoculum in the soil Cercospora leaf spot (Frogeye leaf spot) Cercospora capsici Cercospora lesions on pepper leaf Symptoms Initial symptoms of infection are the formation of small, circular, water-soaked spots on leaves, stems, petioles and/or peduncles; the lesions mature to have white to brown centers surrounded by a brown to red or purple border; as the lesions expand, they may develop a water-soaked outer edge and dark outer ring which gives the lesions a concentric appearance; mature lesions are brittle and cracked in the center; lesions may be between 0.3 and 1.3 cm (0.1â€“0.5 in) in diameter; Cause Fungus Comments Cercospora leaf spot is mainly a disease of tropical and subtropical countries and occurs mainly in Africa, South America, Asia and the West Indies.
In the U.S. it is found mainly in the southestern states Management Cercospora infections are usually minor in pepper and require no treatment; crop debris should be removed and destroyed after harvest or buried in the soil; application of an appropriate fungicide can help to reduce damage if applied early on in the infection; practicing crop rotation reduces the incidence of the disease Damping-off Pythium spp.
Rhizoctonia solani Damping-off of pepper seedling Damping-off of pepper seedling Shriveled stem of infected pepper plant Symptoms Seeds did not germinate; seedlings collapsing and dying; dark stems which are shriveled near the soil line; water-soaked lesions on the stem; water-soaked discolored roots Cause Fungi Comments Disease can be spread in infected soil and irrigation water; disease emergence favored by overcrowded plants and excessive nitrogen fertilization Management Avoid planting in poorly draining, cool, wet soil; planting in raised beds will help with soil drainage; plant high quality seed that germinates quickly; treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting to eliminate fungal pathogens Fusarium wilt Fusarium oxysporum most likely Symptoms Yellowing of foliage and wilting upper leaves; wilting spread to all parts of plant; leaves remain attached to plant and are dark green in color; red-brown discoloration of vascular tissue; plant death Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors high soil moisture content Management Plant pepper in well draining soils and avoid waterlogging Gray leaf spot Stemphylium spp.
Symptoms Initial symptoms of disease appear as small, red-brown spots on leaves measuring 1â€“2 mm in diameter; as disease progresses, lesions expand and turn lighter in the center; lesions expand to 3â€“5 mm in diameter and mature lesions have white or gray centers and red-brown margins; high numbers of lesions may form on leaves causing them to turn yellow and drop from the plant Cause Fungi Comments Disease has worldwide distribution but is most common in peppers grown in the cool-season in tropical and subtropical climates; pathogen also attacks tomatoes Management As pepper nursery beds seem to be more susceptible to gray leaf spot infection, control relies on good management of the beds; beds should be well ventilated and all crop debris should be promptly removed; beds should not be planted next to pepper or tomato fields; if disease is present and spreading then application of appropriate fumigant fungicides should be effective at eradicating the pathogen; lesions on plants in an established field usually do not warrant treatment Powdery mildew Leveillula taurica Powdery mildew symptoms on pepper leaf Pepper leaf infected with powdery mildew Pepper leaf infected with powdery mildew Symptoms Patches of white, powdery fungal growth on the underside of the leaves; yellow to brown discoloration of the upper leaf; edges of leaves may curl upwards exposing the underside of the leaf; leaves may begin dropping from plant Cause Fungus Comments Disease can occur in both humid and dry conditions; disease spreads most rapidly in humid conditions; disease commonly affects older leaves Management Apply appropriate fungicide if disease is severe Southern blight Sclerotium rolfsii As the disease progresses the plant will continue to wilt and leaves will eventually turn brown.
Because the canopy is being destroyed fruit will become more susceptible to sunscald and secondary pathogens. Discolored pepper stem The fungus can often be seen growing as a white mycelial mat growing on the stem and the surrounding soil.The mycelia will develop sclerotia which are light tan to dark brown pathogen survives in the soil or in plant debris, volunteers and weeds.Pepper plant infected with Southern blight Southern blight grows best in warm, humid conditions.The first symptom is the wilting of the the plant to wilt.At the collar region of the stem you will notice a brown blighted section.
Stem lesions on pepper caused by Southern blight Symptoms Sudden wilting of leaves; yellowing foliage; browning stem above and below soil; browning branches; stem may be covered with fan-like mycelial mat Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for long periods; disease emergence favored by high temperatures, high humidity and acidic soil; disease found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, including the southern United States Management Remove infected plants; avoid overcrowding plants to promote air circulation; rotate crops with less susceptible plants; plow crop debris deep into soil; provide a barrier to infection by wrapping lower stems of plant with aluminum foil covering below ground portion of stem and 2-3 in above soil line Verticillium wilt Verticillium spp.
Symptoms Initial symptoms of the disease include plants becoming stunted and lower leaves turning yellow; as the infection progresses, more leaves turn yellow and begin dropping from the plant; plants wilt during the day and recover at night; wilting becomes permanent and plant death ensues.
Cause Fungi Comments Disease is present in pepper grown in Europe, Canada and the U.S.; the severity of the disease when it emerges is dependent on many factors, including the strain of the pathogen, host susceptibility, soil type and prevailing climatic conditions Management There are currently no effective control strategies for Verticillium wilt once it is present in the field; cultural control practices should be employed to lessen the chances of the disease emerging in the first place; management strategies include rotating the crop every 3â€“4 years away from pepper; soil fumigation and/or solarization can reduce the level of inoculant in the soil Category : Bacterial Bacterial canker Clavibacter michiganensis Symptoms Small, raised, white lesions on leaves that grow larger, turn brown and necrotic and may have a yellow halo; raised white lesions on fruit which coalesce to form larger spots, often with white halo Cause Bacterium Comments Symptoms can be mistaken for bacterial spot; disease emergence favors high temperatures and high humidity; disease can be spread between peppers and tomatoes Management Use only certified seed and disease free transplants; treat seeds with hot water prior to planting to kill bacteria; sanitize all equipment regularly; rotate crops with non-solanaceous plants Bacterial spot Xanthomonas campestris Xanthomonas euvesicatoria Xanthomonas perforans = [Xanthomonas axonopodis (syn.
campestris) pv. vesicatoria] Xanthomonas vesicatoria Xanthomonas gardneri A shot hole appearance on a leaf infected with bacterial spot.Symptoms of bacterial spot on pepper foliage Symptoms of bacterial spot on pepper leaf Symptoms of bacterial spot on pepper foliage Symptoms of bacterial spot on pepper foliage Symptoms of bacterial spot on pepper fruit Symptoms of bacterial spot on pepper foliage Symptoms of bacterial spot on pepper foliage Symptoms Water-soaked lesions that dry out and turn brown forming on the underside of the leaves; raised brown cankers on stems; cracked brown lesions on fruit.Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favored by warm, wet conditions; the pathogen can be enter a field on seed and transplants and can be spread within a field by wind-driven rain, clipping plants and aerosols.Management Management Use disease free planting material; remove and destroy all crop debris after harvest, or plow material deeply under soil.
Bacterial wilt Ralstonia solanacearum Bacterial ooze from infected pepper stem Pepper plant killed by bacterial wilt Bacterial wilt symptoms in pepper field Symptoms Upper leaves of plant wilt on hot days and recover in the evening and early morning; affected leaves remain green and attached to the plant; if conditions are favorable to the development of the disease then the entire plant may wilt; vascular tissue in lower stems is often discolored brown; severe infection may result in bacteria oozing from the stems; symptoms are often found associated with low lying areas of fields where water collects Cause Bacteria Comments Most major losses in pepper crop are incurred in tropical and subtropical growing regions; disease also affects tomato, potato, tobacco and eggplant crops; bacteria enter the plants through tiny wounds in roots Management Bacterial wilt is very difficult to control once it is established in a field; cultural control methods include planting disease- free seedlings and ensuring irrigation water is free of the pathogen; plants should not be irrigated excessively to prevent build-up of water which favors the development of the disease; pepper should be rotated with non-susceptible crops to prevent the build up of the pathogen in the soil Category : Other Blossom-end rot n/a Anything that reduces the plants ability to uptake calcium can lead to the development of this disorder, with one of the main reasons being the availability of water.
Symptoms begin as a small, water soaked light brown spot at the blossom end of the fruit. Blossom-end rot on pepper fruit As the fruit grows the spot will also enlarge and may eventually cover up to half of the fruit.Fungi and bacteria may attack the damaged tissue causing tissue discoloration.Blossom-end rot on pepper fruit Symptoms Small water-soaked area on end of fruit where the blossom was occurring or on the side of unripe fruit; lesion enlarges and turns sunken, tan brown and leathery in appearance Cause Low calcium concentration in fruit Comments Physiological disorder; low calcium may result from competition from other ions in soil e.g.
potassium; can also be caused by drought stress; fluctuations in soil moisture or application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer which promotes rapid vegetative growth Management Maintain soil pH at 6.5; lime soil to increase the concentration of calcium in soil and decrease competition with other ions; use mulch to reduce drought stress; avoid ammonium fertilizers as they may increase competition with calcium by increasing ammonium ions in soil, use nitrate instead; avoid over fertilizing Magnesium deficiency Symptoms Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear on older leaves first; initial symptoms are interveinal chlorosis of the leaves and, occasionally, a purple tinge to the leaves; as the deficiency becomes more severe, leaves may appear white with green veins; severe deficiencies may lead to reduced fruit yield Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Magnesium deficiency is rare in field grown peppers but can arise in sandy soils when heavy rain causes leaching Management Magnesium deficiency can be prevented by applying dolomite lime to the soil, if an increase in soil pH is required, or through applications of a fertilizer containing magnesium Nitrogen deficiency Symptoms Plants exhibit reduced growth and leaves are smaller than normal; leaves exhibit a general yellowing; fruit are reduced in size and pale in color; older leaves of the plant show symptoms first and the yellowing progresses to younger leaves Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Nitrogen deficiency usually arises in cmmercial plantations through inadequate fertilizer application; heavy rain can leach nitrogen from sandy soils Management If detected early, symptoms of nitrogen deficiency can be treated by applying appropriate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer Category : Viral Mosaic Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Potato virus Y (PVY) Cucumber mosaic virus symptoms on pepper leaf Cucumber mosaic virus symptoms on pepper foliage Symptoms Alternating light and green areas or mosaic patterns on the leaves; leaves distorted and curled; slow plant growth Cause Virus Comments Transmitted by aphids; weeds can act as a source of inoculum; insecticides are not effective due to the speed with which aphids can transmit the virus Management Remove weeds around crop; use reflective mulches to deter aphids from plants Tomato spotted wilt virus Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) Symptoms on fruit are particularly evident as fruit matures.
This picture is a stunted bell pepper fruit with severe TSWV infection Leaves of infected plants may also develop chlorotic or necrotic ring spots Necorsis of pepper fruit caused by TSWV In addition to chlorosis leaves may also become twisted and distorted. The severity and appearance of symptoms will vary depending on the cultivar, the age of the plant at the time of infection, environmental conditions and the virus isolate.TSWV is transmitted by thrips, which can only acquire the virus as larvae and transmits it as an adult.The initial symptom is chlorosis on leaves Characteristic ring spots on pepper fruit Fruit may also be affected, developing chlorotic or necrotic spots, ring spots or mosaics.
Pepper plant infected with TSWV Symptoms Symptoms may vary widely depending on variety and environmental conditions; generally leaves become spotted and bronzed in appearance; plant may droop or wilt; fruit develop concentric rings which are light in color and become necrotic Cause Virus Comments Virus can infect a wide range of plants including crops, ornamentals and weeds; once acquired by the thrips vector, the insect is capable of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life Management Management of the disease is aimed at control of the thrips vector (see Thrips) Category : Oomycete Phytophthora blight Phytophthora caspsici The pathogen can easily spread through rain splash or running water and wind. Field infestation of Phytophthora blight Phytophthora blight symptoms on pepper fruit Symptoms of the disease includes wilting of the plant.However, other diseases can also cause this symptom and the plants needs to be carefully analyzed for confirmation.
Pepper plants infected with Phytophthora blight A characteristic symptom is the crown rot and black lesion at the crown region which is indicative of the disease. Such symptoms develop especially during high rainfall conditions or in areas with water logging or excessive moisture.
Pepper plant infected with Phytophthora blight Symptoms Black lesions on stems; wilting plant; circular gray-brown lesions on leaves; dark lesions on fruit which may be covered in white sporangia Cause Oomycete Comments Disease highly water dependent and spores can be spread by water splash; disease can move root to root to infect a row of plants Management Plant disease free transplants; manage water carefully as pathogen depends on water for survival; rotate crops; apply appropriate fungicide Pests Category : Insects Aphids Myzus persicae Aphids (and ladybug larva) on pepper leaf Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Young larvae Beet armyworm eggs covered in white hairs Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling the beet armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Larva Adult potato beetle Symptoms Feeding damage to foliage; if infestation is severe or if left untreated plants can be completely defoliated; adult insect is a black and yellow striped beetle; larvae are bright red with black heads when they first hatch and change color to pink; larvae have two rows of black spots Cause Insect Comments Adult beetles emerge in spring; female beetles lay eggs in batches of up to two dozen; eggs are orange-yellow and are laid on undersides of leaves; a female can lay 500 or more eggs over a four to five week period Management Control of Colorado potato beetle can be challenging as they have developed high levels of insecticide resistance; in the home garden planting early maturing varieties of potato allows the plants to escape from most damage; adults and larvae should be hand picked from plants and destroyed in soapy water; applications of Bacillus thuringiensis can be effective at controlling larvae but should be applied frequently; some insecticides, including spinosad, are still effective against adult beetles Flea beetles Various Flea beetles are often metallic in appearance Flea beetle damage Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny and metallic in appearance Cause Insects Comments Flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Leafminers Lyriomyza spp.
Leafminer trails on pepper leaves Leafminer trails on pepper leaves Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larave hatch and feed on leaf interior Cause Insects Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies Leafroller (Omnivorous leafroller) Platynota stultana Strawberry leaf uncurled to reveal leafroller and silk Symptoms Leaves of plant rolled and tied together with silk webbing; feeding damage to rolled leaves; defoliation of plant; silk webbing may also be present on fruits and fruits may have substantial scarring from feeding damage; larvae wriggle vigorously when disturbed and may drop from plant on a silken thread Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a moth which can fly over several miles to find suitable hosts; alfalfa and sugar beet are good hosts Management Monitor plants regularly for signs of infestation; remove weeds from plant bases as they can act as hosts for leafrollers; avoid planting pepper in areas where sugarbeet or alfalfa are grown nearby; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; apply sprays carefully to ensure that treatment reaches inside rolled leaves Pepper weevil Anthonomus eugenii Damage inside pepper fruit Pepper weevil larvae inside a young fruit pod Pepper weevil feeding on the bud of a pepper plant Symptoms Feeding damage to foliage, buds and tender young fruit pods; larvae feed within buds and fruit; older fruit misshapen and discolored; buds and fruit may drop from plant; adult weevil is a small black beetle; larvae are small cream-white grubs with brown heads which can reach 0.6 cm (0.25 in) in length when mature Cause Insect Comments Weevil will go through multiple generations per year; pepper preferred host but weevil will feed on other plants in the nightshade family also Management Remove any nightshade plants growing in close proximity to pepper; immediately remove any dropped fruit from soil surface; if pepper weevil becomes problematic, rotate crop the following year; organically acceptable control methods include sprays of pyrethrin; destroy pepper crop residue immediately after harvest Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Western flower thrip adult Thrips infestation in a pepper blossom Symptoms If population is high leaves and buds may be distorted; leaves appear silvery and are speckled with black feces; insects will feed on and damage flowers; most damage occurs through the transmission of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV); insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Insect transmits Tomato spotted wilt virus (see disease entry); once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Tomato fruit worm (Corn earworm) Helicoverpa zea Mixture of larvae showing range of colors Symptoms Larvae burrowing into fruit near stem end and feeding on fruit interior causing decay; fruit turn red prematurely and fall from plant causing reduced yield; young caterpillars are cream-white in color with a black head and black hairs; older larvae may be yellow-green to almost black in color with fine white lines along their body and black spots at the base of hairs; eggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are initially creamy white but develop a brown-red ring after 24 hours and darken prior to hatching Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a pale green to tan, medium sized moth; can be one of the most damaging pests of tomato; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil; the insect is also a damaging pest of corn and is also referred to as the corn earworm Management About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Early treatment of tomato fruitworms is necessary as once they enter the fruit they are protected from sprays; monitor plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations Category : Mites Spider mites (Two spotted spider mite) Tetranychus urticae Spider mite webs and damage Stippled leaves of pepper plant Spider mite webs and damage Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan , is a perennial shrub in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible pods and seeds.

The seed pods are also edible and are eaten as a vegetable.The leaves and seed husks of the plant can be used as an animal feed.Propagation Basic requirements Pigeon pea grows best in hot humid climates where temperatures are between 18 and 38Â°C (64.4â€“100.4Â°F).The plants will grow in a wide range of soils, from sandy soil to clay and also in soils with low fertility.Pigeon pea will grow optimally in a well drained soil with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0.Once established, pigeon pea is relatively tolerant to drought conditions and can survive for long periods with little irrigation.
Propagation Pigeon pea is propagated directly from seed which should be sown in a prepared seed bed. Seeds should be planted to a depth of 2.5â€“10 cm (1â€“4 in) leaving 30â€“50 cm (12â€“20) between plants and 150 cm (60 in) between rows.Higher seeding rates should be used if the pant is being grown for use as a green manure.Pigeon pea is commonly intercropped with millets, cotton, sorghum or groundnut.General care and maintenance All weeds should be eliminated from the seed bed to prevent competition with the initially slow growing seedlings.Generally, pigeon pea does not require irrigation or fertilization.An application of phosphate at a rate of 20â€“100 kg per hectare is recommended and irrigation may be necessary if the plants are intensively grown.Harvesting Pigeon pea is commonly harvested by hand.Machine harvesting by combine is possible if a variety is grown where pods ripen uniformly.The plant is cut at the ground when the majority of pods have reached maturity.
The plants are air dried and then threshed to remove the seeds.

small, circular, dark green, water-soaked lesions on pods leaves and branches which enlarge and become slimy; cottony white growth may be visible on lesions during periods of high humidity; death of branches and/or entire plant Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for in excess of 5 years; disease can be spread by wind, contaminated irrigation water and by infected seeds Management Rotate crops with non-hosts like cereals and corn; plant rows parallel to direction of prevailing winds to prevent spread of disease from secondary hosts nearby; avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer; use a wide row spacing Category : Bacterial, Fungal Wilt Fusarium udum Symptoms Sudden yellowing of leaves; death of leaves; plant death; blackened tissue at base of stem; symptoms may be present on only one side of plant Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for several years Management Practice long term crop rotation; avoid over or under watering plants Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Cowpea aphid, Pea aphid, etc.) Aphis craccivora Acyrthosiphon pisum Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Armyworms (Beet armyworm, Western striped armyworm) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera praefica Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ;

insect is also very damaging pests of corn; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil Management Monitor plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insect Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Leafminers Lyriomyza spp Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larvae hatch and feed on leaf interior Cause Insects Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Pineapple, Ananas comosus , is an herbaceous biennial or perennial plant in the family Bromeliaceae grown for its edible fruit.
The pineapple plant has a short stout stem and a rosette of sword-shaped leaves with needle-like tips. The leaves are waxy, have upturned spines on the margins and may be soild green or striped with red, white or cream.When the plant flowers, the stem begins to elongate and produces a flower head of small purple or red flowers, each with a pointed bract.The stem continues to elongate and sets down a tuft of of short leaves called a 'crown'.Individual fruits develop from the flowers and fuse to form one large cylindrical fruit topped by the crown.This fruit, known as a pineapple, has a tough rind made up of hexagonal units and a fibrous, juicy flesh which may be yellow to white in color.Pineapple may reach 1.5â€“1.8 m (5â€“6 ft) in height and some varieties can grow for in excess of 20 years.Pineapple originates from the tropical regions of the Americas.
Pineapple fruit Pineapple rind Pineapple flowering Pineapple flowering Pineapple foliage Pineapple fruit ripening Uses Pineapple Content Pineapple fruit is commonly eaten fresh or it may be cooked in a variety of dishes. Pineapple may also be canned or used to produce juice.Propagation Basic requirements Pineapple is a tropical plant and grows best in temperatures between 23â€“32Â°C (73.4â€“89.6Â°F).The plant can tolerate colder temperatures for short periods but will be killed by frosts.Pineapple will grow optimally in well-draining sandy loam which is rich in organic matter.The optimum pH for pineapple growth is between 4.5â€“6.5.Established pineapple plants are tolerant of drought but will not tolerate waterlogged soil which quickly leads to root rot.Propagation Pineapple is propagated from crowns, slips or suckers, with slips or suckers being the preferred method for commercial growers.Pineapple suckers arise from leaf axils, while slips grow from the stalk below the fruit.
These are cut from the parent plant and used to produce new plantings. The cuttings are usually cured for a day or two prior to planting by sitting them in the shade.Pineapple plantings are normally set out in double rows with the material staggered 25â€“30 cm (10â€“12 in) apart within the double row and allowing a further 60 cm (2 ft) between double rows.General care and maintenance Pineapples require supplemental irrigation during dry spells for optimum production.Mulching around the plants will help to conserve soil moisture.Ratooning may also be utilized as a means of encouraging growth.After the first crop of fruit, ratooning the plants will result in new fruit within 18 months.This process may be repeated a second or third time but then the crop will be rotated to prevent build up of disease.Removing suckers and slips from developing plants helps the plant to focus energy on growing the fruit and leads to larger fruit that develops quicker.
Pineapples benefit from the application of additional nitrogen and potassium. Application rates depend largely on the type of soil the plants are growing in.Generally, little fertilizer is required during the first few months following planting but requirements increase rapidly in the period leading up to flower development.Fertilizers are usually applied as foliar sprays.Harvesting Pineapples are ready to harvest when at least one third of the fruit rind has turned from green to yellow.Fruits are harvested by hand by cutting the crown and peduncle from the plant.The fruit will continue to ripen off of the plant.References Bartholomew, D.P., Rohrbach, K.G.& Evans, D.O.(2002).Pineapple cultivation in Hawaii.University of Hawaii Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/f_n-7.pdf.[Accessed 27 March 15].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Ananas comosus (pineapple) datasheet.

Pistachio is a small to medium sized tree with a branching main stem (trunk) and a spreading growth habit. The leaves of the pistachio are pinnate and composed of five individual oval leaflets.Male and female inflorescences are produced on different trees (dioeceous).The flowers are small, brownish-green in color and lack petals.They are produced on panicles, each possessing several hundred flowers.The fruit of the tree is a drupe with an oblong kernel covered with a thin, bony shell.The shell splits along its long axes when mature.Pistachio trees can reach up to 20 ft (65.6 ft) in the wild but are generally smaller under cultivation.They reach maximum productivity in terms of fruit production after approximately 20 years and can live for several hundred years.Pistachio may also be referred to as green almond and originated from western Asia.
Pistachio trees Pistachio tree Pistachio fruit Pistachio buds Pistachio buds Pistachio tree Uses Pistachio Content Pistachio nuts are eaten as a snack food, usually after salting and roasting. Propagation Basic requirements Pistachio trees grow best in areas with a long hot summer and cold winter as the tree has a chilling requirement.The tree is tolerant of frost and can withstand winter temperatures as low as -20Â°C (-4Â°F).Trees are also drought resistant and can be grown on a wide range of soils, including rocky or stony soils, without irrigation but trees will grow optimally in well draining, deep sandy loams.Pistachio trees are wind pollinated and require the planting of both male and female trees for successful pollination and fruit set.Propagation Pistachio is usually propagated by budding on to a suitable pistachio rootstock.Rootstock varieties vary widely between growing areas.
Budding is usually carried out in the Fall with the budded tree being planted the same year or the following year depending on the size of the seedling. Young trees are planted by digging a hole large enough to accommodate the root ball.The tree should be planted about an inch lower than it was grown in the container.Tree spacing varies depending on whether irrigation is used.In irrigated orchard, trees can be spaced in a 6 Ã— 6 m (19.7 Ã— 19.7 ft) grid pattern.In arid regions where supplemental irrigation is not used, trees may be spaced 8 Ã— 10 m (26.2 Ã— 32.8 ft) apart.Both male and female trees must be planted in order for the trees to bear fruit.Ratios of males to females vary from 1:8 to 1:11 males to females.General care and maintenance Pistachios have a similar nitrogen requirement to other nut trees.
Fertilizer should not be applied in the first year following planting but in the subsequent year, each tree should be supplied with 1 lb of ammonium sulfate split between two applications over the course of the growing season. In the years following, trees should be fertilized with actual nitrogen with application rates varying from 100 to 150 lb per acre.The nitrogen should be split evenly into two applications over the growing season.no nitrogen should be applied after June to prevent vigorous growth that may delay the tree entering dormancy, potentially leading to damage from early frosts.Harvesting Newly budded pistachio trees will not begin to produce fruit for five years and will not reach maximum production until the twelfth year.Nuts are ready to harvest when the hull separates easily from the shell.This period extends for 7 to 10 days.If nuts are harvested before or after this critical period kernels may be underdeveloped and shells may become stained.

Musa sapientum ) is an herbaceous perennial belonging to the family Musaceae. Plantains are distinguished from bananas by their fruit which, although morphologically very similar to bananas, are actually longer, firmer and possess a higher starch content and thicker skin than their sweeter relative.Like banana, the plant is tall and tree-like with a sturdy pseudostem and large broad leaves arranged spirally at the top.The leaves are large blades with a pronounced central midrib and obvious veins.They can reach up to 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in length and up to 0.6 m (2.0 ft) in width.Each pseudostem produces a group of flowers from which the fruits develop in an hanging cluster.In commercial plantations, the parent plant dies after harvest and is replaced with a daughter plant.However, a plantation can grow for 25 years or more if managed properly.The trees can reach heights between 2 and 9 m (6.6â€“29.5 ft).
Plantains and the cultivated varieties are derived from ancestors which originated from the Malaysian peninsula, New Guinea and South-East Asia. Plantain tree Uses Plantains are eaten as a vegetable and are cooked prior to consumption.They are an important component of many dishes in Western Africa and Caribbean countries.In addition, the leaves of Musa species can be used as a source of fibre Plantain Content for thread, cloth string, thread or can be used as thatch and roofing.The plants are also grown as an effective source of shade for other crops.Propagation Requirements Plantains grow best in hot and humid climates, require a rainfall of at least 1000 mm (39.4 in) per year to survive and have a high light requirement.Plantains will grow optimally at 27Â°C (98.6Â°F) and require a deep soil, rich in organic matter which is well draining and well aerated.The plants will grow optimally in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0.
Young plantains are very susceptible to wind damage and it is recommended that they are planted in sufficient shelter or in a block so that the plants will protect one another. Suckers Plantains are vegetatively propagated, most often from suckers (shoots that grow from a bud at the base of the plant) or from corms (underground bulbs known as rhizomes).The use of whole corms is very laborious so it is more common to grow from small pieces of corm.There are three different types of banana suckers which are produced by the mother plant; maidenheads, sword suckers and water suckers.Maidenheads have a large pseudostem which does not produce fruit.Sword suckers have a narrow base, short pseudostem and narrow, blade-like leaves.They produce healthy, fruitful pseudostems when they mature Water suckers have short pseudostems and broad leaves.Water suckers are not strongly attached to the rhizome and generally produce weaker plants and less fruit.
Maidenheads and large sword suckers are preferred over water suckers. Planting The desired pieces of the plant are usually planted 30â€“60 cm (11.8â€“23.6 in) deep in the soil and should generally be planted at the end of the dry season or the beginning of the wet season.Plant spacing is dependent on the cultivar being planted.Frequent weeding is required until plants are tall enough to shade out competing plants and should be started about 6 weeks after planting.Plantains are fast growing and require the frequent addition of nutrients as well as additional irrigation in the dry season.Plantain is often grown alongside other crop plants with similar requirements, indeed, the young banana plants make excellent 'nurses' for other crops such as papaya or cocoa which can be grown very close to the young plantains.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Musa datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/35124.[Accessed 05 November 14].Paid subscription required .

The plum tree has an erect growing habit with a spreading canopy. It possesses large, thick, oval-shaped leaves which are darker in color on the upper surface than on the lower and which often have a serrated edge.The tree produces buds on terminal spurs on the branches with each bud generally producing 3â€“5 flowers.The fruit is a fleshy oval fruit with a single seed contained within a stone.The color of the fruit varies with variety and fruits can be purple, blue, green, red or yellow.Plum trees can attain a height of between 6 and 10 m (20â€“33 ft) and can live for periods in excess of 50 years if properly maintained.Plum may also be referred to as European plum and originates from Southwest Asia Plum tree Plum fruits Plum blossoms Plum foliage Plum leaf Plum tree Uses Plum fruits are commonly consumed fresh or used to make jams or jellies.Plums may be dried to produce prunes.
Plum and prune Content Propagation Basic requirements Plums grow best in areas with warm summers and require a summer temperature between 20 and 30Â°C (68-86Â°F) for the fruit to mature. The trees also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy.Plum trees grow best in well-draining sandy loams in areas that receive full sun but can will grow in a variety of soils as long as water does not sit on the surface after heavy rainfall.It can be beneficial to plant the trees on elevated land to allow cold air to drain away.Trees will grow optimally in soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 Propagation Plum trees are propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent.Plum rootstocks are commonly used but plum may also be grafted onto peach, Japanese apricot and almond rootstocks.Plum trees should be planted in full sun.Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole which is slightly wider than the root ball.
Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth ensuring that the bud union is above the soil line. It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark.If planting multiple trees they should be spaced 2.0â€“2.5 m (6.6â€“8.2 ft) apart.Most plum varieties are self fruitful but cross pollination may be required for fruit set.Plums are pollinated by honeybees and it can be beneficial to maintain bee hives in orchards.General care and maintenance Plums should be pruned annually, including the year of planting and are best trained to an open center.When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to prevent the tree from over-bearing.Aim to have 1 fruit every 15â€“20 cm (6â€“7 in).This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year.Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development.
During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days. Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy.Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring.Harvesting Plum fruits should be allowed to mature on the tree.Fruits can be picked by hand when the skin has turned the color typical of the variety being grown.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Prunus domestica (plum) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/44278.[Accessed 30 March 15].Paid subscription required .Ogawa, J.M., Zehr, E.I., Bird, G.W., Ritchie, D.F., Uriu, K.& Uyemoto, J.K.(eds) (1995).Compendium of Stone Fruit Diseases.American Phytopathological Society Press.Available at: http://www.apsnet.org/apsstore/shopapspress/Pages/41744.aspx.Available for purchase from APS Press .Parker, D.(1999).Plum.Clemson Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/vegetables/tree_fruits_nuts/hgic1358.html.

The pomegranate tree is branched and spiny with glossy, leathery, oval to oblong leaves that grow in whorls of five or more on the branches. The tree produces bright red flowers singly at the tips of the branches and a rounded hexagonal fruit with a thick pink-red skin.The fruit has a thick, leathery rind which protects the pulp[ and seeds inside.The inside of the fruit is separated into compartments by white spongy tissue.Each compartment contains seeds and pulp.Each pomegranate fruit may contain as many as 600 seeds.Pomegranate trees can reach a height of 10 m (33 ft) and can be very long lived, although their economic lifespan is usually between 12 and 15 years.Pomegranate may also be referred to as grenadine or Chinese apple and originated from Central Asia, likely in Iran.
Fruits and foliage Pomegranate flower Pomegranate and seeds Pomegranate tree in flower Pomegranate flowers Pomegranate fruit Uses Pomegranate is primarily eaten as a fresh fruit by splitting open the rind and consuming the seeds. The seeds may be Pomegranate Content used in salads.The fruit may also be used to produce juice, either by removing and pressing the seeds or by pressing the whole fruit.Propagation Basic requirements Pomegranates grow best in temperate or semi-arid climates with a cool winter and warm summer.They are less hardy than many other deciduous fruit trees but more hardy than citrus.Pomegranates will suffer severe damage when temperatures drop below -10Â°C (14Â°F).Pomegranate can be grown successfully on a range of soil types, including calcareous soils and acidic loam but will grow optimally in deep, well-draining loam.Propagation Commercial pomegranate trees are propagated from softwood and hardwood cuttings as seeds will not breed true to type.
Hardwood cutting are generally preferred over softwood due to the ease with which they root. Hardwood cuttings are taken from shoots or suckers from the previous season and are rooted in nursery beds after treatment with a rooting hormone.Cuttings are grown in the nursery for one season before being planted out in the orchard.Rooted cuttings are best planted in winter or early spring and are usually spaced 3.5â€“5.5 m (11.5â€“18 ft) apart.The young trees are headed back to a height of 60â€“70 cm (23â€“28 in) after planting to promote branching.General care and maintenance Pomegranates have a similar water requirement to citrus trees and should be provided with additional irrigation during dry periods.Pomegranate orchards usually utilize drip, furrow or sprinkler irrigation systems to promote optimal yields.Pomegranates can be pruned to a single stemmed tree or allowed to grow as a multi-stemmed bush.Suckers should be removed from around the central trunks as they develop.
Pomegranates will benefit from the addition of nitrogen. Nitrogen should be applied at a rate of 0.2â€“0.5 kg per tree each year.Pomegranate fruits are usually thinned to promote the production of larger fruits Harvesting Pomegranate fruits are generally ready to harvest between 6 and 7 months after flowering, fruits should be allowed to mature fully on the branch prior to harvest as they will not continue to ripen off of the tree.Fully mature fruit turn bright red in color and make a metallic sound when tapped.Fruits should be harvested by cutting from the tree.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2012).Punica granatum (pomegranate)) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/45931.[Accessed 31 March 15].Paid subscription required .Stein, L., Kamas, J.& Nesbitt, M.(2010).Pomegranates.Texas A&M AgriLife Extension.Available at: http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/fruit- nut/files/2010/10/pomegranates.pdf.[Accessed 31 March 15].Free to access .

They are native to the Andes Mountains in South America and have been grown for thousands of years. Potatoes are a staple food in many countries around the world and are used in a wide variety of dishes.They are high in carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins C and B6.Potatoes are typically planted in the spring and harvested in the late summer or early fall.They grow best in well-drained soils with a pH between 4.5 and 7.5.Potatoes require a lot of water, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages, and they are sensitive to frost.The crop can be propagated from seed potatoes, which are small tubers that are planted in the soil.They can also be propagated from potato seed, which is a less common method.Once the seed potato or seed is planted, the plant will grow leaves and flowers, and then it will produce tubers underground.The potato is a herbaceous perennial plant grown for its edible tubers.
The plant has a branched stem and leaves consisting of leaflets that are both unequal in size and shape and can be oval to oblong in shape. The leaves can reach up to 10â€“30 cm in length.Tubers grow about 25 cm underground in the soil and can be yellow, red, or purple depending on the variety.The potato plant produces white or blue flowers and yellow-green berries.The plants can go up to 1m (3.3ft) in height.Potatoes are grown in many countries across Africa, but the main potato-producing countries are Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Kenya.In these countries, potatoes are grown both for local consumption and for export.Potatoes are a relatively new crop in Africa, having been introduced to the continent in the late 19th century.However, since then, potato production has increased significantly, with farmers in Africa recognizing the potential of the crop as a food security and income generation opportunity.
Potatoes grow well in the cool highland regions of Africa, where the temperature and rainfall are suitable for the crop. However, potato cultivation in Africa is often challenged by a lack of access to quality seed potatoes, a lack of irrigation systems, and the prevalence of pests and diseases.FAOSTAT reports that production of potatoes in Africa has more than doubled, with eastern Africa producing the biggest yield.The crop is primarily produced by small-holder farmers, with Algeria leading in production with 4,928,028 tons per year, overtaking Egypt, which produces 4,800,000 tons per year.The following is a summary of the physical attributes of potato crops: Leaves: The leaves of the potato plant are simple and alternate.They are generally dark green and glossy in color and are smooth or slightly hairy.They are lobed or ovate in shape and can grow up to 15 cm long.Stems: The stems of the potato plant are green, smooth, and slightly hairy.
They grow to a height of 30â€“90 cm and are usually unbranched. Flowers: The potato plant produces small, white or purple flowers that grow in clusters.These flowers are typically about 2 cm in diameter and have five petals.Tubers: The tubers are the underground storage organs of the potato plant and are the part of the plant that is typically consumed as a vegetable.They are round or oblong in shape and can vary in size and color depending on the variety.They can be white, yellow, red, or purple.Root: The potato plant has a deep taproot and fibrous root system that allow the plant to absorb water and nutrients from the soil.Fruits: Potato plants produce small, green, and poisonous berries that are typically not consumed by humans.Potato flower Potato field in flower Potatoes being harvested in the garden Potato harvest Potato foliage Potato Varieties Potatoes are grown in many countries across Africa, and different varieties are grown depending on the region and the local market.
For example, in Egypt, the most common variety grown is Desiree, which is a red-skinned variety with a waxy texture that is good for boiling and mashing. In South Africa, farmers grow varieties such as "Bintje," "Sifra," and "Agria," which are known for their high yields and good storage capabilities.In Ethiopia, farmers grow varieties such as "Sarpo Mira," which is known for its resistance to pests and diseases, and "Shepody," which is known for its good taste and texture.In Kenya, farmers grow varieties such as "Kenya Mpya,"Â â€œShangiâ€​, and "Kenya Raha," which are known for their high yields and good taste.It's worth noting that Africa has a rich diversity of local varieties of potatoes known as "landraces." These varieties have been developed and adapted to the local conditions and have the potential to provide food security and income for the farmers.
However, the use of improved varieties and the adoption of good agricultural practices are necessary to achieve the full potential of potato production in Africa. Uses Potato tubers are a staple food source in temperate regions and are eaten after cooking.They may be cut or sliced and made into potato chips or fries.Potatoes can also be processed into starch, alcohol or flour.Nutritional Information Potatoes are a good source of carbohydrates, potassium, and vitamin C; they are also a source of fiber, vitamin B6, and folate.They are low in fat, calories, and sodium.The values shown in the following table are approximate and may vary depending on the variety, growing conditions, and preparation method of the potatoes.Additionally, cooking and processing methods such as frying or mashing can change the nutritional value of potatoes and increase their calorie and fat content.
Propagation Climatic conditions, soils and water Potatoes are a cool-season crop that grows best in certain climatic, soil, and water conditions. 1.Climatic conditions : Potatoes prefer a cool climate with moderate temperatures and a long growing season.They grow best at temperatures between 10â€“15 Â°C (50â€“59 Â°F) during the day and 5â€“10 Â°C (41â€“50 Â°F) during the night.Potatoes are sensitive to frost, and temperatures below 0Â°C (32Â°F) can damage the tubers.Potatoes also require a moderate-to-high amount of rainfall or irrigation.2.Soil conditions : Potatoes grow best in well-drained soils that are rich in organic matter and have a pH between 4.5 and 7.5.They prefer soils that are high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and also require adequate levels of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur.Potatoes also grow well in sandy loam or clay soils.3.Water conditions : Potatoes require a lot of water, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages.
They need about 1-2 inches of water per week, and more in hot and dry weather. They prefer consistent moisture throughout the growing season but also require good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot.Potatoes are sensitive to drought and water stress, which can cause reduced yields and lower-quality tubers.It's worth noting that while these are the ideal conditions for growing potatoes, the crop can be grown in a wide range of conditions, and some varieties are more tolerant to different conditions than others.Additionally, agronomic practices such as fertilization, irrigation, and crop rotation can help to improve the growth and yields of potatoes in challenging environments.Planting Procedure The planting procedure for potatoes generally includes the following steps: 1.Preparing the soil : The soil should be well-drained and have a pH between 4.5-7.5.
Prior to planting, the soil should be worked to a fine tilth, and any necessary amendments such as fertilizer or lime should be added. 2.Choosing seed potatoes : Seed potatoes should be disease-free and certified.They should be cut into pieces with at least one "eye" per piece, and should be left to dry for a few days before planting to allow the cuts to heal over.3.Determining the planting date : The best time to plant potatoes will depend on your climate and the variety you are growing.Potatoes are typically planted in the spring, after the last frost date, and when the soil has warmed up to around 10-15Â°C (50-59Â°F).4.Planting the seed potatoes : Seed potatoes should be planted at a depth of around 10-15 cm, with the "eyes" facing upward.They should be spaced around 30-40 cm apart, in rows that are 75-90 cm apart.5.Watering and mulching : After planting, the soil should be watered well to settle the soil around the seed potatoes and to encourage germination.
A layer of mulch, such as straw or grass clippings, can be applied to help retain moisture and suppress weeds. 6.Care and maintenance : As the plants grow, they will require regular watering, fertilization, and weeding.The plants should be hilled up (soil should be added to the base of the plant) as they grow to prevent the tubers from being exposed to sunlight, which can cause them to turn green and become inedible.Harvesting Harvesting potatoes is the process of collecting the tubers, which are the edible part of the potato plant, from the soil.The timing of the harvest is crucial and will depend on the variety of potato being grown.Generally, potatoes are ready to be harvested when the foliage has died back and the skin of the tubers has hardened.Before harvesting, farmers need to check the tubers for maturity.This can be done by gently digging up a few plants and checking the size and skin of the tubers.
The tubers should be fully formed, and the skin should be tough enough that it can't be easily scraped off with your fingernail. When it comes to the actual harvesting process, farmers should be careful not to damage the tubers.They should be carefully dug up using a spade or potato fork, taking care not to damage the tubers.It's better to harvest when the soil is dry and not wet.After harvesting, the tubers should be placed in a warm, dark, and well-ventilated place for a week or two to "cure" (harden the skin) before being stored.After curing, the tubers should be cleaned of any dirt and debris, and any damaged or diseased tubers should be removed and discarded.Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated place with a temperature between 4 and 8 Â°C (39 and 46 Â°F) and a relative humidity of 90 to 95 %.It's important to harvest potatoes at the right time to ensure the best quality and storage potential.
Overripe potatoes have a higher chance of spoilage and can't be stored as long as mature ones. Additionally, it's also important to properly cure, clean, and store the tubers to ensure they maintain their freshness and quality for as long as possible.Potatoes should be planted in shallow trenches Seed potatoes and seed pieces curing before planting References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Solanum tuberosum (potato) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/50561.[Accessed 31 March 15].Paid subscription required .Erhardt, W.H.(2000).Growing potatoes.University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://extension.unh.edu/resources/representation/Resource000606_Rep628.pdf.[Accessed 31 March 15].Free to access .Rowell, B.(2006).Potatoes.University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://www.uky.edu/Ag/NewCrops/introsheets/potatoes.pdf.[Accessed 31 March 15].Free to access .Stevenson, W.R., Loria, R., Franc, J.D.

Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Bacterial Bacterial ring rot Clavibacter michiganensis Potato plant showing ring rot symptoms Cross-section of infected potato tuber showing ring of discolored vascular tissue Symptoms Wilting stems and leaves; dying leaves; lower leaves wilting first; ring of creamy yellow to brown rot visible when tuber is cut crossways Cause Bacterium Comments Becterium is tuber-borne; bacteria can enter tuber through cutting wounds; disease favored by wet, warm soils; bacteria overwinter in potato debris Management Plant only certified seed potatoes - certified seed potatoes are grown in seed beds with zero tolerance of ring rot; remove all crop debris from soil after harvest; sanitize tools and equipment regularly Blackleg (Soft rot) Erwinia carotovora Soft rot symptoms on potato tubers Symptoms Small, water-soaked lesions on base of stems originating from seed piece; lesions may enlarge to form a large extended lesion stretching from base of stem to canopy; tissue becomes soft and water-soaked and can be lighty brown to inky black in color; wilted, curled leaves which have a soft and slimy texture when wet Cause Bacterium Comments Bacteria are carried on tubers and in wounds and can be spread to healthy tubers during handling and cutting of seed pieces; disease emergence favors high soil temperatures Management Plant seed pieces which are the product of tissue culture; sanitize tools and equipment when cutting seed pieced to prevent bacterial contamination; avoid damaging tubers during harvest; reduce periods of leaf wetness by allowing enough time for leaves to dry throughout the day after watering Common scab Streptomyces spp.
Tubers showing symptoms of common scab Symptoms Raised brown lesions on tubers with corky texture; deep, pitted brown or black lesions on tuber with straw-colored translucent tissue underneath Cause Bacterium Comments Disease is most severe during warm and dry conditions Management Common scab can be very difficult to manage and prevention of the disease relies on combining several different methods.
These include: avoiding planting infected tubers, using a 3-4 rotation away from potato; planting less susceptible potato varieties (none are immune); maintaining a high soil moisture content for 4-6 weeks after stolon tips begin to swell at the onset of tuber development; amending soil to lower pH and treating seed with appropriate fungicides when available Category : Fungal Black dot Colletotrichum coccodes Symptoms Small black dots (fungal fruiting bodies) on tubers, stolons and stems; roots may rot below ground; leaves may turn yellow and wilt; infection may cause defoliation Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors poorly draining soil; poor aeration of soil and high temperatures; disease symptoms are most severe in coarse soils that are low in nitrogen Management Stressed plants are more susceptible to black dot; rotate crops away from potato; do not plant infested tubers or seed pieces; fertilize and water plants adequately; protective fungicides can be applied where available Black scurf & Rhizoctonia canker Rhizoctonia solani Potato tuber covered with fungal fruiting bodies Potato tuber covered with fungal fruiting bodies Death of potato plant due to infection with Rhizoctonia Symptoms Flat, irregularly shaped black or dark brown fungal fruiting bodies on tuber surface; tubers may be mishapen; red-brown to black sunken lesions on sprouts; lesions may girdle the main stem causing leaves to curl and turn yellow Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can be spread by infested soil or planting infected seed pieces and tubers; disease emergence favors cool, moist soil Management No potato varieties are completely resistant to the disease; control relies on reducing the level of inoculum in both the soil and in tubers; methods include applying fungicide to seed pieces or soil; avoiding planting seeds too deeply in cold soils and rotating crop away from potato to reduce levels of soil inoculum Gray mold Botrytis cinerea Symptoms Flowers covered in gray, fuzzy mold; wedge shaped tan lesions on leaves; a slimy brown rot may be present on stems, originating from the petiole; infected tubers have wrinkly skin and tissue underneath is soft and wet; tubers often develop a gray fuzzy growth Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors excessive humidity, cool temperatures and shade Management Cultural control is very important for managing the disease, provide plants with adequate fertilizer and water; application of appropriate protective fungicides where available can provide adequate control of disease but will not treat an established infection Pink rot Phytophthora erythroseptica Symptoms Stunted plant growth; wilting leaves; dying leaves; marked tuber decay; dark brown eyes on tuber; cut tuber turns pink after 20-30 min air exposure, then turns brown and finally black Cause Oomycete Comments Disease emergence favors high soil water saturation late in the season Management Plant potato in well-draining soils with no history of pink rot; avoid overwatering plants; avoid wounding during harvest Potato Early Blight Alternaria solani Close-up of leaf lesion caused by early blight Destruction of potato plants by early blight Symptoms of early blight on potato foliage Symptoms Dark lesions with yellow border which may form concentric rings of raised and sunken tissue on the leaves and stems; lesions initially circular but become angular; leaves become necrotic but remain attached to plant; dark, dry lesions on tubers with leathery or corky texture and watery yellow0green margins Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cycles of wet and dry conditions with periods of high humidity and leaf wetness Management Application of appropriate protective fungicide can reduce severity of foliar symptoms; reduce stress to plants by fertilizing and watering adequately; plant late varieties which are less susceptible to disease; store tubers in cool environment Powdery scab Spongospora subterranea Powdery scab lesions on potato tuber Close-up of powdery scab lesions Symptoms White to brown galls on the roots and stolon; raised pustules on tuber surrounded by potato skin; shallow depressions on tuber filled with brown spores Cause Fungus Comments Symptoms all occur below ground Management Do not plant tubers showing symptoms of disease; avoid planting potato in poorly draining soils; if disease occurs rotate crop away from potato for a period of 3-10 years and avoid planting tomato Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae Verticillium albo-atrum Yellowing potato foliage caused by Verticillium infection Symptoms Early death of plants; leaflets dying on only one side of the petiole or branching stem; cut through the stem reveals a discoloration of the tissue; discoloration of tubers at stem-end Cause Fungi Comments Disease emergence favors high temperature and moisture early in season followed by drought; disease can be spread to uninfected fields by wind or movement of infested soil particles Management Planting resistant varieties of potato is the most common method of controlling the disease; cultural practices such as using furrow irrigation in place of sprinkler irrigation and avoiding overwatering plant can also reduce the severity of the disease should it occur Category : Early Blight Symptoms Cause Comments Early Blight Leaf Symptoms

Category : Other Leak Pythium spp.
Symptoms Light tan, water soaked area around wound on tuber; internal rotting of tuber which results in internal tissue becomes spongy and possibly developing cavities; dark, watery fluid exudes from the tuber when squeezed Cause Fungi Comments Disease only affects tubers and fungus can only enter through wounds; all common potato cultivars are susceptible to leak; disease emergence is favored by relatively high temperatures Management Rotating crops away from potato and destroying any infected tubers helps to control the disease; infection can be reduced by application of appropriate foliar fungicides; delaying harvest to allow the skin of the tuber to mature reduced the risk of injury to the tuber Potato Viral Disease Symptoms Cause Comments Category : Oomycete Potato Late Blight Phytophthora infestans Infected leaf showing the distinctive white sporulating area Diseased leaf on potato plant Late blight lesions on leaf Potato plant destroyed by late blight Symptoms Irregularly shaped spreading brown lesions on leaves with distinctive white fluffy sporulation at lesion margins on the underside of the leaf in wet conditions.
In dry condition the lesions dry up and go dark brown with collapsed tissue; water-soaked dark green to brown lesions on stems also with characteristic white sporulation; later in infection leaves and petioles completely rotted; severely affected plants may have an slightly sweet distinctive odor; red-brown firm lesions on tubers extending several centimeters into tissue; lesions may be slightly sunken in appearance and often lead to secondary bacterial rots. Cause Oomycete Comments The pathogen can survive for several months to years in the soil; emergence of disease favored by moist, cool conditions; major cause of disease spread is infected tubers Management Control depends on a multifaceted approach with importance of certain practices changing based on geographic location: destroy infected tubers; destroy any volunteer plants; application of appropriate fungicide to potato hills at emergence; time watering to reduce periods of leaf wetness e.g.
water early to allow plant to dry off during the day; plant resistant varieties; apply appropriate protective fungicide if disease is forecast in area Category : Viral Potato leaf roll Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) PLRV-infected plant next to an uninfected potato plant Plant infected with PLRV Symptoms Young leaves rolled and yellow or pink; lower leaves have leathery texture and roll upward; necrotic netting in vascular tissue of tuber may be present; plant exhibits an upright growth habit and growth may be stunted Cause Virus Comments Transmitted by several species of aphid; infected seed tubers and volunteer potato plants provide a source of inoculum for the virus Management Grow plants produced clonally from PLRV-free stock; harvest potato crop early in temperate regions to avoid aphid migrations late in season; remove and destroy infected plants and tubers; application of appropriate insecticides where available may help reduce spread Potato virus A Potato virus A (PVA) Symptoms Mild mosaic pattern or mottling on leaves; severely infected plants may have alternating patches of yellow and dark green tissue; leaves may have a shiny appearance; stems bending outwards slightly Cause Virus Comments Virus is transmitted by several species of aphid and can be transmitted to the next potato generation by planting infected tubers; tubers show no visible symptoms Management Plant material which is free of PVA; plant tolerant potato varieties in areas where virus is common; application of appropriate systemic insecticides helps to control aphid populations` Potato virus X Potato virus X (PVX) Symptoms Mild mosaic pattern on leaves; severely infected plants may be dwarved with smaller leaves; necrosis of plant tops and tubers may occur Cause Virus Comments PVX can be transmitted by infected leaves coming into contact with healthy ones Management Planting seed free of PVX is the most important method of controlling the virus Potato virus Y Potato virus Y (PVY) Symptoms of PVY on potato leaf Symptoms of PVY on potato tuber Symptoms Symptoms vary widely from mild mosaic of leaves to leaf necrosis and plant death depending on the variety of potato and the strain of the virus: leaves may turn yellow and drop from plant; symptoms may be present on only one shoot of the plant; plants with severe leaf necrosis may produce tubers with light brown rings on the skin Cause Virus Comments Virus is transmitted by more than 25 different species of aphid; virus can be transmitted over long distances by aphids; can be transmitted mechanically by contact with infected leaves or tubers Management Plant only certified seed potatoes; application of appropriate systemic insecticides, where available, may control spread of virus within a single plantation but will not prevent spread caused by winged aphids; remove and destroy symptomatic plants; plant resistant varieties Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Peach aphid, Potato aphid) Myzus persicae Macrosiphon euphorbiae Adult potato aphid and offspring Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insects Comments Aphids are most damaging to potato through the transmission of viruses such as Potato leafroll virus; distinguishing aphid features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Filed infestation of potato beetles Larva Adult Colorado potato beetle Symptoms Feeding damage to foliage; if infestation is severe or if left untreated plants can be completely defoliated; adult insect is a black and yellow striped beetle; larvae are bright red with black heads when they first hatch and change color to pink; larvae have two rows of black spots Cause Insect Comments Adult beetles emerge in spring; female beetles lay eggs in batches of up to two dozen; eggs are orange-yellow and are laid on undersides of leaves; a female can lay 500 or more eggs over a four to five week period Management Control of Colorado potato beetle can be challenging as they have developed high levels of insecticide resistance; in the home garden planting early maturing varieties of potato allows the plants to escape from most damage; adults and larvae should be hand picked from plants and destroyed in soapy water; applications of Bacillus thuringiensis can be effective at controlling larvae but should be applied frequently; some insecticides, including spinosad, are still effective against adult beetles Cutworms Agrotis spp.

(Cucurbita maxima, Cucurbita moschata etc.) Local names: Budho (Luo), Malenge (Kiwahili), Lisiebebe (Luhya), Marenge (Kikuyu), Risoa (Kisii), Ulenge (Kamba) Order: Cucurbitales Family: Cucurbitaceae Genus: Cucurbita spp. Pumpkin fruit Pumpkin Flower Pumpkin flowering Pumpkin plant Pumpkin leaves General Information Pumpkin is the name given to a group of plant species in the genus Cucurbita, including Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita Pumpkin Content mixta, Cucurbita maxima, and Cucurbita moschata.It is grown primarily as a vegetable or ornamental plant.Pumpkins have long-running, bristled stems, large deeply-lobed leaves often containing white blotches, and yellow or orange flowers separated into male and female types on the same plant.The fruit is variable in shape and color but is often white, cream, or green, containing about 70% flesh and several large white seeds.Pumpkin plants are short-lived annual or perennial vines with branching tendrils and broad lobed leaves.
The plant produces large yellow or orange flowers and a pepo fruit (berry with a thick rind) known as a pumpkin. The fruit can range greatly in size, from miniature pumpkins weighing a few ounces to giant pumpkins which can reach over 75 lbs (34 kg).The skin of the pumpkin is usually ribbed and is usually orange in color although some varieties are green, grey, yellow, or red.Pumpkin plants are usually grown as annuals, surviving one growing season and the vines are capable of reaching 15 m (50 ft) in length if vines are allowed to root.Pumpkin may also be referred to as squash or marrow and is believed to have originated in Mexico and South America.Varieties of butternut available in Kenya "Butternut 401".It has resistance to powdery mildew "Bugle".It has resistance to powdery mildew."Early Butternut F1".It has resistance to powdery mildew."Ultra F1".It has resistance to Fusarium wilt and powdery mildew."Waltham".It has resistance to powdery mildew.
Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management Pumpkins and squashes (various Cucurbita spp.) are grown in the tropics from the lowlands up to 2500 m altitude. They are warm-season crops adapted to monthly mean temperatures of 18-27Â°C.C.maxima is the most tolerant of low temperatures, C.moschata and C.argyrosperma the least, with C.pepo intermediate.C.maxima and C.pepo have long been cultivated in temperate regions.Butternut appreciates part shade in very hot conditions, such as can be obtained when intercropped with other crops or grown under fruit trees.Pumpkins and squashes respond very well to medium to heavy applications of compost or well-decomposed manure.They can be cultivated on almost any fertile, well-drained soil with a neutral or slight acid reaction (pH 5.5 to 7).They are drought-tolerant, require relatively little water, and are sensitive to waterlogging.
Excessive humidity is harmful because of the development of leaf diseases, so none of the species do well in the humid tropics. Uses Pumpkin flesh, leaves, and flowers can be cooked and eaten in a variety of dishes.The seeds are also edible and are commonly roasted and eaten as a snack.Ornamental gourds are cultivars of C.pepo with small, bitter, and inedible fruits in many shapes, sizes, and colors.The pumpkin has been used as a medicine in Central and North America.It is a gentle and safe remedy for several complaints.The seeds are widely used as an anthelmintic.The complete seed, together with the husk, is used to remove tapeworms.The fruit and seed decoctions have been reported to be used as diuretics and to reduce fevers, and are used for curing indigestion.The pulp is applied to burns and scalds, inflammation, abscesses, and boils.It is also used in the treatment of migraine and neuralgia.Planting Procedure Pumpkins and squashes are grown from seed.
Seeds may be sown in containers and transplanted to the field when they are 10 cm high. Direct seeding of 2 to 3 seeds per hill is commonly practiced.Trailing types are planted at distances of 2-3 m either way; the seed requirement is 2 to 3 kg/ha.The bushy types (mainly C.pepo) are planted closer, for example, plants spaced 60 to 120 cm in rows 1 to 1.5 m apart; the seed requirement is 3 kg/ha for pumpkin and 7 kg/ha for summer squash (C.pepo).Do not use seeds from plants where edible pumpkins and ornamental gourds are grown close together.Offspring will be bitter or even inedible.Husbandry Sole cropping is sometimes used for commercial production.Pumpkins and squashes are also planted in home gardens or mixed with field crops such as maize.Cultural practices to improve growth and development include the removal of growing tips (in trailing varieties) to check growth, and the bagging of fruits in paper to protect against fruit flies and other pests.
Fruit sets may be stimulated by manual pollination. The fruit may rot when in contact with moist soil, so often cut grass or leaves are placed beneath the fruit.Harvesting Winter squashes and pumpkins are picked when mature in a once-over harvest or in several rounds, about 90 to 120 days after planting depending on the variety.Pumpkins are considered to be among the most efficient vegetable crops when evaluated on nutritional yield land area and labor needed.Indicative figures for the seed yield of C.pepo are 400 to 1500 kg/ha.A valuable source of oil and protein is thus neglected if the seeds are left unutilized.In seed production, isolation between fields of different Cucurbita species is recommended, not only for the reason of purity but also for obtaining maximum yields (pollen of other species may cause reduced fruit set).References Anderson, C.R.Pumpkins.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-6074.pdf.

Powdery mildew on pumpkin leaves Symptoms of powdery mildew on pumpkin vines Powdery mildew on pumpkin leaf Symptoms White powdery mold on stems, leaves and petioles; stems may be weakened Cause Fungi Comments Disease emergence favors periods of dry weather Management Plant in sites with good air circulation and sun exposure; do not overcrowd plants; sanitize equipment regularly Septoria leaf spot Septoria cucurbitacearum Symptoms Initial symptoms of disease are small dark water-soaked spots on the leaves which turn beige to white in dry conditions; lesions develop thin brown borders and the centers may become brittle and crack; small white spots may erupt on the surface of infected butternut and acorn squash and pumpkin fruit Cause Fungus Comments Pathogen can survive on crop debris for periods in excess of 1 year Management Scout plants during cool wet conditions for any sign of spots; early application of an appropriate protective fungicide can help limit the development of the disease if spots are found, cucurbits should be rotated with other crops every 2 years to prevent the build-up of inoculum; crop debris should be removed and destroyed after harvest Southern blight Sclerotium rolfsii Southern blight symptoms on pumpkin fruit Southern blight symptoms on pumpkin fruit Southern blight symptoms on pumpkin fruit Southern blight symptoms on pumpkin fruit Southern blight symptoms on pumpkin fruit Symptoms Sudden wilting of leaves; yellowing foliage; browning stem above and below soil; browning branches; stem may be covered with fan-like mycelial mat; rot on fruit that begins on side in contact with soil Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for long periods; disease emergence favored by high temperatures, high humidity and acidic soil; disease found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, including the southern United States Management Remove infected plants; avoid overcrowding plants to promote air circulation; rotate crops with less susceptible plants; plow crop debris deep into soil; provided a barrier to infection by wrapping lower stems of plant with aluminum foil covering below ground portion of stem and 2-3 in above soil line Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae Symptoms Symptoms generally appear after fruit set; chlorotic leaves which develop necrotic areas; leaves collapsing; symptoms only on one side of vine; discoloration of vascular tissue in roots Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for many years; disease emergence favored by cool or mild weather in Spring Management Do not plant in areas where other susceptible crops have been grown previously; delay planting until temperatures are warmer Category : Bacterial Angular leaf spot Pseudomonas syringae Symptoms Small water-soaked lesions on leaves which expand between leaf veins and become angular in shape; in humid conditions, lesions exude a milky substance which dries to form a white crust on or beside lesions; as the disease progresses, lesions turn tan and may have yellow/green edges; the centers of the lesions dry and may drop out leaving a hole in the leaf Cause Bacterium Comments Spread through infected seed, splashing rain, insects and movement of people between plants; bacterium overwinters in crop debris and can survive for 2.5 years Management Use disease-free seed; do not grow plants in field where cucurbits have been grown in the previous 2 years; protective copper spray may help reduce incidence of disease in warm, humid climates; plant resistant varieties Bacterial leaf spot Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms of bacterial spot on pumpkin fruit Symptoms Dark, angular lesions on leaves; leaf lesions may coalesce and cause severely blighted foliage; water-soaked lesions which enlarge and develop into tan scabs, or blisters, on the fruit; blisters eventually flatten as they reach their full size Cause Bacterium Comments Jack-o-lantern varieties particularly susceptible; disease can spread rapidly in a field; disease can be introduced through contaminated seed Management Avoid overhead irrigation; rotate crops away from cucurbit species to prevent disease building up; use new seed each planting as saved seed is more likely to carry bacteria; apply appropriate protective fungicides; copper containing fungicides generally provide good control Bacterial wilt Erwinia tracheiphila Symptoms of bacterial wilt (image of closely related summer squash) Symptoms Wilting of individual runners or entire plant; leaves and stems of affected parts turn dark green; wilting is irreversible; affected parts turn necrotic Cause Bacterium Comments Spread by striped or spotted cucumber beetles; disease can be confirmed by cutting the stem and slowly pulling the two ends apart - infected plants will ooze strings of bacterial exudate Management Control cucumber beetle populations on plants; hand pick adult beetles and destroy; soil and foliar application of appropriate insecticides may help to control populations Category : Other Aster yellows Aster yellows phytoplasma Symptoms Foliage turning yellow; secondary shoots begin growing prolifically; stems take on a rigid, upright growth habit; leaves are often small in size and distorted, may appear thickened; flowers are often disfigured and possess conspicuous leafy bracts; fruits are small and pale in color Cause Phytoplasma Comments Disease is transmitted by leafhoppers and can cause huge losses in cucurbit crops Management Remove any infected plants from the field to reduce spread; control weeds in and around the field that may act as a reservoir for the phytoplasma; protect plants from leaf hopper vectors with row covers Category : Viral Cucumber mosaic Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Symptoms Plants are severely stunted; foliage is covered in distinctive yellow mosaic; leaves of plant curl downwards and leaf size is smaller than normal; flowers on infected plants may be deformed with green petals; fruits become distorted and are small in size; fruit is often discolored Cause Virus Comments Transmitted by aphids; virus has an extensive host range; can be mechanically transmitted via tools etc.
Management Control of the virus is largely dependant on the control of the aphid vectors; reflective mulches can deter aphid feeding; aphid outbreaks can be treated with mineral oils or insecticidal soap applications; some resistant varieties are available Squash mosaic Squash mosaic virus (SqMV) Symptoms Symptoms vary with variety being grown but plants can show symptoms which include include green veinbanding, mottled leaves, blisters, ring spots or potruding veins at leaf margins; some squash varieties may develop leaf enations; infected plants are often stunted and fruits may be malformed with mottled skin Cause Virus Comments Virus can be transmitted through infected seed and spread by striped cucumber beetles Management Use only certified disease-free seed Watermelon mosaic Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) Symptoms Symptoms vary widely depending on species, cultivar, virus strain and environmental conditions; symptoms on leaves may include green mosaic patternation, green vein-banding, chlorotic rings and disfigured leaves Cause Virus Comments Virus is found in almost all Cucurbit growing regions in the world; virus is spread by over 20 aphid species Management Treatments that control populations of aphid vectors can also reduce the incidence of the virus; spraying plants with mineral oils or insecticidal soaps can help to reduce aphid numbers Zucchini yellow mosaic Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) Symptoms Infected plants are severely stunted and leaves can exhibit a variety of symptoms including yellow mosaic patternation, severe deformation, blistering, reduced size and necrosis; fruits are deformed Cause Virus Comments DIsease can cause devastating epidemics when present Management Use of resistant varieties, where available, is usually the most effective method of controlling the virus; control of aphid populations on the plants can be achieved through the use of mineral oils and insecticidal soaps but is rarely effective at controlling the virus Category : Oomycete Phytophthora blight Phytophthora capsici Symptoms of Phytophthora blight on pumpkin fruit Symptoms of Phytophthora blight on pumpkin fruit Symptoms Sudden and permanent wilting of plant; leaves do not change color; plant death within a few days; roots and stem close to soil line discolored light to dark brown; plant easily removed from soil; fluffy mold growing on soft rotting fruit Cause Oomycete Comments Disease emergence favors warm, moist conditions Management Efficient management of water to avoid saturated soil; avoid long periods of irrigation Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Green peach aphid, Melon aphid) Myzus persicae Aphis gossypii Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Armyworms (Beet armyworm, Western striped armyworm, etc.) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera praefica Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully Cucumber beetles (Western striped cucumber beetle, Western spotted cucumber beetle, Banded cucumber beetle) Acalymma vittata Diabrotica undecimpunctata Diabrotica balteata Pumpkin plant infested with cucumber beetles Western spotted cucumber beetle Pumpkin plant infested with cucumber beetles Western striped cucumber beetle Banded cucumber beetle Symptoms Stunted seedling; damaged leaves, stems and/or petioles; reduced plant stand; plants may exhibit symptoms of bacterial wilt; scars on fruit caused by beetle feeding damage; adult beetles are brightly colored with either a green- yellow background and black spots or alternating black and yellow stripes Cause Insect Comments Beetles overwinter in soil and leaf litter and emerge from soil when temperatures begin to reach and exceed 12.7Â°C (55Â°F) Management Monitor new planting regularly for signs of beetle; floating row covers can be used to protect the plants from damage but will need to be removed at bloom to allow bees to pollinate plants; applications of kaolin clay can be effective for management of small beetle populations; application of appropriate insecticides may be necessary Cutworms Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Cutworm larva severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Flea beetles Epitrix spp.

The tree has crowded, gnarled branches and a crooked growth habit. The leaves have a smooth upper surface and hairy lower surface.The tree produces single white-light pink colored flowers on tiny shoots and a large, fragrant, pome fruit.The fruit is initially covered in dense gray-white hairs but these disappear as the fruit ripens.The ripe fruit is a golden yellow color and resembles a pear or apple depending on variety.It has a soft, yellow pulp with a grainy texture protected by a thin skin.Quince trees can reach heights of 5â€“8 m (16â€“26 ft) and can live for periods in excess of 50 years and have an economic lifespan of approximately 25 years.Quince originates from Asia Minor.Quince fruit Quince blossoms Quince blossom Quince fruit Quince fruits Quince fruits Uses Quince fruits are consumed fresh or may be used to make jams and jellies.
Quince Content Propagation Basic requirements Quince trees grow well in a wide range of climates and soils but the plants shallow root system make it susceptible to drought or a low availability of water and additional irrigation may be required. Quince should be planted in full sun and will grow optimally at temperatures averaging 15Â°C (59Â°F).Quince trees are more tolerant of wet soils and drought than apple trees and, compared with other fruit trees, has good cold tolerance, being hardy to temperatures between -15 and -25Â°C (5 and -13Â°F respectively).Quince trees are easily damaged by strong winds and should be planted in a sheltered location which will also protect them from rapid temperature fluctuations which is also detrimental to their growth.Propagation Quince trees are usually propagated from hardwood cuttings or by budding onto a quince rootstock.
Seeds can be grown but will not breed true to type and should not be used for commercial purposes where fruit quality is very important. Some varieties are not self compatible and require another variety for successful pollination and fruit production.Quince trees should be spaced 5â€“6 m apart (16â€“20 ft) apart, allowing 4â€“5 m (13â€“16 ft) between rows.General care and maintenance Quince trees are susceptible to fire blight and should not be fertilized excessively with nitrogen as this promotes vegetative growth which makes the trees more susceptible to the bacterium.Suckers should be removed by pruning from the tree in winter or early spring.Trees should be pruned in winter to thin out fruiting wood and stimulate new growth.If fruiting wood is pruned properly then fruits should not require thinning when the trees are bearing.Quince will benefit from regular deep watering during the summer months.Harvesting Quince fruits should be harvested when they are mature but not full ripe.
Fruits will continue to ripen off of the tree and by harvesting in this manner, losses from fruit dropping from the tree are reduced. Fruit should be cut from the tree using a sharp knife as pulling them can cause damage to the skin.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Cydonia oblonga (quince) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/17341.[Accessed 02 April 15].Paid subscription required .Eames-Sheavly, M.(2003).Minor fruits.Cornell University.Available at: http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/fruit/homefruit/11minorfruit.pdf.[Accessed 02 April 15].Free to access Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Brown rot Monolinia spp.

The top leaves of the plant are smaller and lance-like.The taproot of the plant is cylindrical or tapering and commonly red or white in color.The radish plant produces multiple purple or pink flowers on racemes which produce 2â€“12 seeds.The reddish brown seeds are oval, and slightly flattened.Radish is generally grown as an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach 20â€“100 cm (8â€“39 in) in height depending on the variety.Radish may also be referred to by the name of the cultivar and names may include Chinese radish, Japanese radish or oriental radish.The origin of the radish plant has not been determined but they are found growing native from the Mediterranean to the Caspian Sea.
Harvested radishes Radish plants Radish flowers Radish flower Radish seed pods Radish Uses Radish Content The radish root can be eaten fresh in salads or cooked with other ingredients such as meat. The leaves of the plant are also edible and can bu used as a salad green.Propagation Basic requirements Radishes are fast growing cool-season vegetables that grow very well in cool moist climates.the optimum temperature for the growth of radishes is between 10 and 18Â°C (50â€“65Â°F) and they grow best in a well- draining sandy loams which are rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.8 and 6.8..Radish should be grown in full sun to part shade.Propagation Radish is propagated directly from seed into a prepared bed.Seeds should be planted in late winter to early spring for the first spring crop and plantings can be staggered to provide a continuous harvest.A small amount of nitrogen may be applied to the soil prior to planting (up to 60 kg per hectare).
Seeds should be planted at a depth of 1 cm (0.5 in), allowing 2.5 cm (1 in) between individual plants and a further 30 cm (12 in) between rows. Commercial producers may drill seeds using planting rates of 30â€“40 kg per hectare.General care and maintenance Radishes will benefit from the addition of small amounts of nitrogen fertilizer at regular intervals spaced over the growing season.Seedlings should be kept uniformly moist as they develop, but not wet.Weeds should be carefully removed from around the plants.Harvesting Radishes usually reach full maturity between 30 to 50 days after sowing.They should be harvested promptly as over-mature radishes become woody and develop a bitter taste.The plants may be topped by cutting back the leaves to a height of 7â€“10 cm (2.8â€“3.9 in) prior to harvesting, or whole plants can be pulled from the soil.Roots should be washed prior to storing to increase longevity.References Anderson, C.R.Radishes.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.

The rapeseed plant has several erect, branched stems originating from a single base, the stems are purple in color towards the base. The leaves of the plant are bluish-green and mostly smooth.The basal leaves are stalked whereas the highest leaves grow straight off of the stem.The plant produces pale to bright yellow flowers which are 11â€“15 mm (0.4â€“0.6 in) in diameter, and after pollination the plant develops pods containing a single row of seeds.Each pod can contain 20â€“40 dark brown to black seeds.The rapeseed plant can reach 1.0â€“2.5 m (3.3â€“8.2 ft) and is grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season.Rapeseed may also be referred to as colza, oilseed rape, canola, swede rape or fodder rape and is believed to originate from the Mediterranean.
Flowers Seeds Fruits of rapeseed Flowers and fruit of rapeseed Rapeseed fields Rapeseed field Flowers and seed pods Rapeseed Rapeseed flowers Rapeseed (colza) Content Flower close-up Uses The seeds of the plant are used to extract rapeseed oil which can be used as a cooking oil or in the production of margarine. Some recently developed cultivars have a high erucic acid content which is extracted for the production of industrial oil.Rapeseed is also grown as fodder for livestock.Propagation Basic requirements Rapeseed is adapted to grow in cool, moist climates, requiring a temperature range of 2â€“10Â°C (35.6â€“56Â°F), although temperatures closer to 10Â°C (56Â°F) promote the most rapid growth.As a result, rapeseed is grown as a cool season crop in sub-tropical regions and a winter crop in more temperate areas.Rapeseed can be grown on a variety of soil types but medium textured, well-draining soils work best.Rapeseed should be grown in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 8.3.
Rapeseed should not be grown in soil in which other brassicas have been grown within the past 3â€“4 years. Propagation Rapeseed in almost always propagated from seed which is sown in prepared fields by drilling in rows.Seeds are sown shallowly as the seeds are very small and seed should be sown at a depth of 2â€“3 cm (0.8â€“1.2 in).Spring crops of rapeseed should be drilled in rows 18â€“23 cm (7â€“9 in) apart, whereas winter crops require more space and should be drilled in rows approximately 40 cm (16 in) apart.General care and maintenance It is important to control weed growth in rapeseed fields as they can have a significant impact on the growth and productivity of the crop.Good preparation of the seedbed helps to limit weed growth.This is achieved by tilling the soil in the fall prior to planting, followed by shallow cultivation just prior to seeding.
Rapeseed has a high nutrient requirement and a soil test should be carried out prior to planting in order to prevent nutrient deficiencies from occurring. fertilizers are most successfully applied to the side of the seed furrows to prevent damage to the plants.Nitrogen fertilizer should be applied at a basic rate of 50â€“60 kg per hectare for spring planted rapeseed and 70 kg per hectare for winter crops.Fertilizer is commonly applied at time of sowing.in addition to nitrogen, rapeseed may also require the addition of phosphorus, potassium, sulfur and magnesium to the soil.The rate of application of these nutrients should be determined by a soil test.Harvesting Rapeseed is a fast-ripening plant and is ready for harvest when the seeds have turned from green to black in color.Rapeseed is mechanically harvested by combine or by swathing.in some countries, such as China, the crop is cut by hand.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2011).Brassica napus var.napus (rape) datasheet.

Cause Insect Comments Cabbage aphids feed only on cruciferous plants but may survive on related weed species. Management Insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Cutworms (Black cutworm) Agrotis ipsilon Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insect Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Flea beetles Phyllotreta cruciferae Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insects Comments Flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Raspberry is the name given to two plant species in the genus Rubus , Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus occidentalis (black raspberry) grown for their edible fruit.
Raspberry plants have perennial root systems and biennial stems which are known as canes. The canes are woody, erect and shrub-like and generally undergo a period of growth one year and fruit production the next although primocane varieties exist that produce fruit in the first year.The canes may possess spines.Raspberry plants produce white or pink flowers with five petals which are surrounded by green sepals.After the plant has been pollinated, an aggregate berry is produced which consists of numerous druplets which are held together into the familiar raspberry fruit by tiny hairs.Raspberry canes can grow from 0.5 to in excess of 2 m (1.6â€“6.6 ft) in height and red raspberry will produce a commercial yield of fruit for 16â€“20 years, while black raspberry has a shorter lifespan and will produce for 4â€“8 years.
Red raspberry may also be referred to as European raspberry, red garden raspberry or hindberry, while black raspberry may be referred to as blackcap raspberry and may have originated in the Ide mountains of Turkey. Raspberry foliage Raspberry fruits ready to harvest Raspberry blossoming Raspberry cane with new shoot Raspberry drupelets Ripe raspberries Uses Raspberry Content Uses Raspberries are primarily consumed as a fresh fruit or may be processed into jams, jellies, juices and pulp.Propagation Requirements Raspberry plants grow best in regions with cool summers and relatively mild winters.The plants are sensitive to high temperatures and grow best when daytime temperatures are around 25Â°C (77Â°F).Raspberries are best suited to well-draining sandy loams, rich in organic matter and have a pH between 5.5 and 6.5.Drainage it critical in raspberry propagation as the plants are susceptible to root rot.
Plants require full sunlight and should not be planted in low lying areas where water may build up. Raspberries also require a post support system or trellis to support the weight of the fruit on the canes.Raspberry canes are biennial and produce fruit in the second year of growth.Canes in their first year of growth are called primocanes and those in the second year of growth are called fruiting canes or floricanes .The young canes are green in color, whereas the older floricanes are tougher and have a woody covering making them easy to tell apart.Preparation Soil may need prepared up to two years in advance of planting if major amendments are required.Acidic soil can be amended with lime to bring the pH up to a level suitable for raspberries.Organic content can be increased by planting a cover crop or by the addition of manure or compost.
Avoid planting raspberries where peppers, eggplant, tomatoes or potatoes have been grown previously as these plants are host to Verticillium fungi which can cause root rot in raspberries. Choose a raspberry variety which is suited to your region.Red raspberries tend to be the most cold hardy, whereas black or yellow varieties are more sensitive.Planting and trellising Many raspberry varieties are very vigorous and using a support system such as a trellis will help to protect the canes from wind damage while also supporting the weight of the fruit crop.The trellis should be constructed before or at planting to avoid damaging the young plants after they are in the ground.The traditional method of supporting red raspberry canes is a post and wire system.This method involves running two wires about 60 cm (2 ft) apart vertically between wooden posts staked into the ground.The lower wire should be positioned 90 cm (3 ft) from the ground and the upper 1.5 m (5 ft) from the ground.
The raspberry canes can then be tied to the wires. A second option is a T-trellis which is similar to the post and wire but the vertical wooden posts each have two cross bars to attach the wire.Two sets of wires run parallel to one another, one above the other.The vertical posts should be spaced 3.6â€“4.6 m (12-15 ft) apart with the lower wire positioned 90 cm (3 ft) from the ground and the upper 1.5 m (5 ft) from the ground.Raspberry plants in the home garden are usually grown from bare root plants or from tissue-cultured plants and should be planted in early Spring when the danger of any severe frosts has passed.The plants are usually planted in a row and the suckers will fill in the spaces to produce a hedge.Plant approximately 70 cm (27.5 in) apart, allowing 2.4â€“3 m (8â€“10 ft) between rows.Pruning Allow the raspberry plants to fill in the row to a width of about 30â€“38 cm (12â€“15 in) during the course of the growing season.
Remove any suckers which are produced outwith this row. After harvest, cut the fruited canes of summer- fruiting varieties to ground level.Select 6â€“8 of the strongest young canes on each plant and tie them to the supporting wires so that they are spaced 8â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in) apart.Cut all of the canes of Autumn fruiting varieties to ground level after harvest.Cut back canes as needed in the summer if required to prevent crowding.T-trellis system Raspberries are usually planted in a row and allowed to fill in to create a hedge Post and wire trellis system References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2014).Rubus idaeus (raspberry) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/48002.[Accessed 06 April 15].Paid subscription required .Ellis, M.A.& Converse, R.H.(Eds.) 1991.Compendium of raspberry and blackberry diseases and insects.American Phytopathological Society.APS Press.Strick, B.C.(2008).growing raspberries in the home garden.Oregon State University Extension.

The large leaves are arranged in a rosette and have fleshy petioles which are often red in color and can reach 1â€“1.5 m (3.3â€“4.9 ft) in length The leaves are large and palmate with an irregular undulating edge. The plant produces small, green-white flowers on the end of an erect stem.Rhubarb plants can reach 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in height and 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter and petioles can be harvested for many years.Rhubarb is sometimes also referred to as pieplant and likely originated from Northern China and Siberia.Field of rhubarb Rhubarb stalks Rhubarb seeds Rhubarb plant Rhubarb leaf Rhubarb (Brandy Carr Scarlet) Rhubarb plant Rhubarb foliage Rhubarb crowns Rhubarb Content Uses The rhubarb petioles can be eaten fresh or cooked, usually with sugar to balance the sharp flavor of the plant.Rhubarb is a popular ingredient in pies and desserts.Propagation Basic requirements Rhubarb grows best in temperate climates with cool summers and winters which result in the ground freezing.
The plant requires winter temperatures below 4.4Â°C (40Â°F) to break dormancy. Rhubarb will grow optimally at temperatures of 15â€“20Â°C (59â€“68Â°F) and is adapted to high rainfall as long as there is adequate drainage.Plants will grow best in a fertile, well-draining soils rich in organic matter with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.Propagation Rhubarb can be propagated from seed but it is more common to grow from whole crowns or cut pieces of the crown (divisions).Each division of the crown should possess at least one healthy bud.Crowns should be planted as soon as possible after purchasing/dividing to prevent them drying out.This is best performed in early Spring to allow the new plants to establish in the soil.Choose a site that receives full sun.An area that receives afternoon shade may be beneficial in warmer areas.Prepare the site for planting by loosening the soil with a fork to a depth of approximately 25 cm (10 in).
Encorporate organic matter such as a good quality compost or well-aged manure into the soil prior to planting and a small amount of fertilizer. Rhubarb crowns and divisions Planting should be planted at a depth of 5 cm (2 in) leaving 1 m (3.3 ft) between plants and 1.5â€“1.8 m (5â€“6 ft) between rows.Once in the ground, tamp the soil firmly around the crowns and water deeply.General care and maintenance Rhubarb requires regular watering during dry weather.a layer of organic mulch such as straw applied over newly planted crowns will help to conserve soil moisture while suppressing weeds.The soil should be kept moist but not wet.Rhubarb should be fertilized with nitrogen to promote vigorous and healthy growth.Nitrogen can be supplied at planting through the addition of well composted manure or a good quality compost.Nitrogen side-dressings should be made at regular intervals throughout the growing season.Rates should be adjusted based on the results of a soil test.
Harvesting Rhubarb should not be harvested in the first year after planting if the plant is to be maintained as a perennial. In the second year, stalks may be harvested as they mature.Leaves should be fully mature prior to harvest.Stalks should be harvested by hand cutting.Always ensure that foliage remains on the plant.Do not overharvest.References Bratsch, A.& Mainville, D.Rhubarb.Virginia Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/438/438- 110/438-110_pdf.pdf.[Accessed 06 April 15].Free to access .Riofrio, M.Growing rhubarb in the home garden.The Ohio State University Extension.Available at: http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/1000/pdf/1631.pdf.[Accessed 06 April 15].Free to access .Schrader, W.L.(2000).Rhubarb production in California.University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources.Available at: http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/8020.pdf.[Accessed 06 April 15].Free to access .

Scientific Clarification The following are the crop details for Rice: Scientific name: Oryza sativa Local names: Mchele(husked rice), Mpunga (upland rice)- Swahili Order: Cyperales Family: Poaceae Genus: Oryza Rice growing terraces in the Philippines Mature Asian rice panicles Rice terraces in Vietnam Asian rice field Asian rice with panicles Asian "basmati" rice` Rice Content General Information There are two species of cultivated rice in the world, Oryza sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza glaberrima (African rice). Both species are annual grasses (except in the tropics, where the plant can be perennial) that are cultivated for their grain which is considered a staple food in most parts of the world.Asian and African rice plants are morphologically very similar and can be difficult to tell apart.They have rounded stems (called culms) which are divided into nodes and internodes.The plant leaves are borne on the nodes of the stem and are long and slender with a pronounced midrib.
The plant produces three flowers, two of which are reduced, on a spikelet on the terminal (last) internode of the stem. The rice grain is formed by the ripened ovary of the flower and is between 5 and 12 mm in length.Rice is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season, and can reach a height of between 1 and 1.8 m (3.3â€“ 5.9 ft) depending on the variety.Rice is grown in four ecosystems, which are broadly defined based on water regimes.The ecosystems are irrigated rain- fed lowland and upland, and flood-prone.Generally, African rice tends to form smaller, pear-shaped grains with red bran and olive to black seed coat and has several disadvantages compared with its Asian counterpart e.g.seed is easily scattered, the grain is difficult to mill and the crop gives a lower yield.The growing of Asian rice has therefore begun to supersede that of African rice in West Africa.
Asian rice originates from China and African rice is believed to have been domesticated in areas around the Niger River in Africa. Rice Varieties in Kenya "Sindano", highly susceptible to Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV), and "Basmati 217", highly susceptible to blast, have been grown since the 1960s.Basmati 217: Grain yield 4.6 t/ha; very good cooking quality; resistant to RYMW and susceptible to blast.Basmati 370: Grain yield of 5.3 t/ha; very good cooking quality; resistant to RYMW and susceptible to blast.IR 2035-25-2: Grain yield of 5.5 t/ha; good cooking quality; moderately susceptible to RYMW and moderately resistant to blast.IR 2793-80-1: Grain yield of 6.4 t/ha; good cooking quality; susceptible to RYMW.BW 96: Grain yield of 9.0 t/ha; fair cooking quality; susceptible to RYMW and moderately resistant to blast.UP 254: Grain yield of 6.4 t/ha; good cooking quality; moderately susceptible to RYMW and moderately resistant to blast.

Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management Rice thrives on land that is water saturated or even submerged during part or all of its growth. Optimal temperatures for rice growing are 20 to 37.7Â°C, and no growth occurs below 10ÂºC.The optimal pH is between 5 and 7, though rice has been grown in fields with a PH between 3 and 10.Rice will grow in altitudes ranging from 0 to 2500 m above sea level but worldwide is mostly grown on the humid coastal lowlands and deltas.Aquatic rice may require a dependable supply of fresh, slowly moving water, at a temperature of 21 to 29Â°C.Rain-fed rice requires an average of 800 to 2000 mm of rainfall well distributed over the growing season.If rainfall is less than 1250 mm annually, irrigation is used to make up the deficit.The crop is salt tolerant at some stages of growth; during germination but not seedling stages and has even been grown to reclaim salty soils.
Terrain should be level enough to permit flooding, yet sloped enough to drain readily. The soils on which rice can grow are as varied as the climatic regime it tolerates, but ideally, it prefers a friable loam overlying heavy clay, as in many coastal and delta areas.Zinc deficiency (2) Zinc deficiency (1) Nitrogen deficiency (2) Plants showing Phosphorous deficiency Symptoms of potassium deficiency (3) Nitrogen deficiency Symptoms of potassium deficiency (2) Symptoms of potassium deficiency Severe calcium deficit leaves Planting Procedure Rice is always propagated by seed, which may be either broadcast or drilled directly in the field, or the seedlings may be grown in nurseries and transplanted.Direct seeding is done in dry or puddled soil.In puddled soil, the (pre-germinated) seeds are broadcast.The water level is kept at 0-5 cm under tropical conditions, but higher in temperate areas.
In dry soil, the seeds are sown after land preparation and covered lightly with soil by a tooth harrow. Germination occurs after heavy continuous rains.In upland rice cultivation the land is prepared in the dry weather and the rice is broadcast or dibbled in with the advent of the rains.Floating rice is cultivated in areas subject to deep flooding and the seed is sown either dry or wet.Seedling production The following are steps for producing healthy seedlings: Seed selection: Select plump and healthy seeds.Seed pre-treatment: This is practiced to secure better germination of seeds and better growth of seedlings.It involves: Seed disinfection: Hot water treatment is effective in destroying the nematode Aphelenchoides besseyi, which causes white tip disease.Seed soaking: To supply the required moisture for germination, shorten the germination period and reduce seed rotting.During the soaking period change water to remove poisonous substances and allow entry of fresh air.
Pre-sprouting: The seeds are drained and covered with grass for 24 to 48 hours. This ensures uniform seed germination, avoids sprouting, and allows air circulation for germination.Sowing: Sowing 80 to 100 g/mÂ² is normal practice.Broadcast seed uniformly.Do not submerge the nursery bed after sowing.Use a seed rate of about 20 kg/acre (50 kg/ha).Seedbed preparation (nursery): Plough at least 2 weeks before sowing and flooding.Puddle 1 week before sowing and prepare a raised nursery bed.Drain the nursery bed the day before sowing to stabilize the surface of the soil.If the soil covering the nursery bed is too soft, sown grains are buried in the soil resulting in a poor establishment.For 1 ha of transplanted rice, a nursery of about 350 mÂ² is required.Irrigate a few days after sowing so that the surface is kept moist, and as the seedlings emerge keep submerged conditions with water controlled at 1 to 3 cm according to the growth of the seedling.
Raise the water level to 10 cm one day before uprooting to ease the washing off of soil that sticks to roots. This will make transplanting easy.Land Preparation Preparation of land varies, even within the lowland rainfed-rice areas.Land can be prepared in the following ways: Wetland tillage: This method is common in most tropical Asian countries.It consists of land soaking, in which water is absorbed until the soil is saturated.Ploughing, which is the initial breaking and turning over of the soil to a depth of 10-20 cm, is done using a wooden or light iron plough drawn by 1-2 buffaloes or oxen, preferably when there is 7.5-10 cm of water on the land and harrowing during which big clods of soil are broken and puddled with water.Puddling is important because it reduces moisture loss by percolation, better weed control, and ease of transplanting.
The low redox potential of submerged puddled soil helps to conserve water-soluble nutrients, favors the accumulation of ammonium, increases biological nitrogen fixation, and increases the availability of phosphorus, silicon, iron, and manganese. Dryland tillage: The land is prepared in the dry weather and the rice is sown just before the rains begin.This method makes it possible to have initial crop growth from early monsoon rains.Labor requirements for seed-bed preparation, land preparation, and transplanting are reduced and soil structure is better for stand establishment of the following non-rice crop.This method has its disadvantages: weed control is a major problem; percolation losses are high, making the chances of drought stress higher; and fertilizer requirements are often higher.To hold the water on the land and maintain it at the required depth, bunding and leveling are essential.
The land is divided by contour bunds into fields, the size and shape of which vary with the topography. The bunds are usually made of clay, mud, and weeds, with controlled openings for the ingress and egress of water.

The rosemary plant is usually erect in growth habit and possess branched woody stems with tufts of leaves. The leaves are opposite and usually bladelike and glossy green.The plant produces clusters of 5â€“10 blue, purple or pink flowers on short lateral branches and small oval fruit.Rosemary plants can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in height and can be productive for many years (up to 30 if conditions are favorable for its growth).Rosemary originates from the Mediterranean.Rosemary Rosemary flowers close-up Rosemary flowers Rosemary flowering Rosemary foliage Rosemary Uses Rosemary leaves can be used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking or in salads.The leaves and flowers can be used to extract rosemary oil which is used as a seasoning or as a scent in soaps and household products.
Rosemary Content Propagation Basic requirements Rosemary is suited to both temperate and subtropical areas with most varieties growing optimally at temperatures between 6 and 24Â°C (39â€“75Â°F) in a well-draining loamy soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Rosemary plants require at least 6 hours of sun every day, direct sunlight being best.Rosemary can survive mild winters but will not tolerate temperatures that are regularly below -3Â°C (26.6Â°F).Established rosemary is very drought resistant.Propagation Rosemary can be propagated from seed, cuttings, or by air layering.Seeds germinate slowly, emerging after 3â€“4 weeks, and have a low germination rate so vegetative propagation is preferred.Cuttings should be taken from healthy, vigorous plants by taking a clipping about 7.6 cm (3 in) in length from the end of a branch.The leaves should be removed from the lower half of the cutting before planting in light textured potting media to root.
The cutting should be watered regularly and kept moist, but not wet while they root. The new plants will be ready for transplanting after approximately 8 weeks.after hardening, transplants should be planted 45 cm (18 in) apart allowing 1.2 m (4 ft) between rows.General care and maintenance Rosemary is very prone to root rot and should therefore be planted in a well-draining soil and watered sparingly.Allow the soil to dry before watering, generally watering once every 1â€“2 weeks is sufficient but watering should be adjusted to suit climatic conditions.Plants will benefit from the regular addition of a balanced fertilizer.A layer of mulch will protect the plants over winter.Harvesting Rosemary can be harvested as soon as the plant is established in the the ground and has reached a suitable size.Branches are harvested by cutting the terminal growth (25â€“30 cm/9.8â€“11.8 in) before they become woody.
Rosemary can be harvested several times in one season but it is important to allow the plant to recover and replace growth before the next harvest.

The plant is believed to be a hybrid of turnip and wild cabbage. The leaves grow from a stout swollen stem (neck) close to the ground forming the crown the plant.Rutabaga leaves are thick smooth and waxy.They are lobed and have a bluish hue.The plant produces light yellow flowers which are clustered at the top of a raceme.Unlike turnip, the flowers do not extend above the terminal buds.The taproot of the plant is is a bulbous tuber, almost perfectly round, which can be purple, white or yellow with yellow flesh.Rutabaga plants can reach in height of 30â€“46 cm (12â€“18 in) and although biennial, they are commonly grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season.Rutabaga may also be referred to as swede or yellow turnip and originates from Europe.Uprooted rutabaga plants Uses Rutabaga roots are usually consumed as a vegetable after cooking.The leaves are also edible and can be eaten fresh in salads or after cooking.
Propagation Rutabaga Content Propagation Basic requirements Rutabagas are cold hardy vegetables which can be grown early in the spring for a summer harvest or in the summer for harvesting in late fall. They prefer a fertile, well draining soil which has a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.The soil should have a loose texture for optimum root development.Rutabagas will grow best in full sun but will tolerate partial shade.The average daily temperature should fall between 10â€“18Â°C (50â€“65Â°F) for adequate growth.Planting Rutabagas are usually direct seeded and can be sown as soon as the soil is workable in the Spring.For a Fall harvest, sow seeds about 2 months before the first frost in your area.Prepare the soil for planting by loosening it with a fork to a depth of about 30â€“38 cm (12â€“15 in).Remove any large rocks if present.Incorporate 2â€“4 inches of compost into the soil prior to planting.Sow seeds by broadcasting and raking 13 mm (0.5 in) into the soil.
Thin seedlings to a final spacing of 7.5â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in). Alternatively, seeds can be sown in rows spaced 30â€“45 cm(12â€“18 in) apart.General care and maintenance Water rutabagas evenly and keep the soil moist for optimum growth.Mulching the plants will help to conserve moisture in the soil.Pull any weeds as they appear, the soil can be cultivated down to 2.5â€“5.0 cm (2â€“3 in) when the plants are small but this should be reduced as the plants grow larger to prevent damage to delicate feeder roots.Harvesting Rutabaga greens can be harvested from the plant when the leaves are about 10 cm (10 in) tall.If growing for both greens and roots then only remove 2â€“3 leaves from each plant.Roots are ready to harvest when they reach 2.5â€“7.5 cm (1â€“3 in) in diameter.Small rutabagas can often be harvested by gently pulling from the soil by hand but larger roots in heavier soil may need gently dug up with a garden fork.Store unwashed roots in a root cellar or basement.

Rye has an erect slender stem topped with a curved spike which is 7â€“15 cm (3â€“6 in) length. The head is made up of individual spikelets each with two florets which produce 1â€“2 kernels.The spikelets and arranged alternately along the length of the head.The leaves of the plant grow from nodes on the stem and are lance-like blades, blue-green in color.Rye can reach 1â€“3 m (3.3â€“10 ft) in height and is either grown as an annual (spring rye) or biennial (winter rye).Modern rye does not occur naturally but is likely derived from wild ancestors found in Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East.Rye ripening Rye Rye Uses Rye grain can be used to make alcoholic drinks such as whiskey, gin and beer or used as a livestock feed.Rye flour can be used to make bread.Rye is extensively grown as a winter cover crop to prevent soil erosion and the mature stems are commonly used as animal bedding.
Propagation Rye Content Propagation Basic requirements Rye is a cool season annual grass which can be grown in a wide range of soils and climates. Rye grows best when planted in well draining sandy or light loams but can also be grown in clay soils.The optimum pH for rye growth is between 5.6 and 6.5.Rye will germinate when soil temperatures are between 4 and 5Â°C (39â€“41Â°F).Daily temperatures should not exceed an average of 20Â°C in order for the plant to grow adequately.Winter rye should be planted in fall to mid-winter depending on the variety and be overwintered for a summer harvest, while spring rye is planted in the spring for summer harvest.Propagation Rye is propagated directly from seed and can be sown by broadcasting or by drilling.Seeds should be sown to a depth of 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) allowing 15â€“18 cm (6â€“7 in) between rows where seeds are drilled.Seeding If seeds are broadcast, they must be covered to ensure adequate germination.
Seeding rates are generally between 100 to 150 kg of seed per hectare for winter rye and 150 to 200 kg per hectare for spring rye to produce a plant stand of 200-300 plants per square meter. General care and maintenance Rye fields should be kept free from weeds through the use of herbicides or by harrowing.Herbicides may be applied while the plants are at the tillering stage of growth.Rye will benefit from the addition of nitrogen which is often the biggest yield limiting factor in rye cultivation.Fertilizer should be applied when the crop begins to grow and the application may be split over two applications.Harvesting Rye is ready to harvest when the leaves are dead and the stems have turned yellow-brown in color.Rye is commonly harvested by combine but can also be harvested by hand.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Secale cereale (rye) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/49471.[Accessed 07 April 15].Paid subscription required .USDA NRCS.

Sage can be erect or grow along the ground and possesses a dense arrangement of woody stems with broad, elliptical,silvery-green leaves which are arranged alternately on the stems. The plant produces blue, pink or white flowers on a stalk.Sage plants generally grow to 40â€“70 cm (16â€“28 in) in height and can live to be 15â€“20 years old although they are usually replaced after 4â€“5 years in the garden when they become woody.Sage may also be referred to as common sage and originates from the Balkan peninsula.Purple leaf sage Sage flowers Bumble bee visiting a sage flower Sage flowering Sage Golden sage Uses Sage leaves are used fresh or dry as a culinary herb.Oil can be extracted from the leaves and flowers of the plant and is used as a flavoring in alcoholic drinks and as a scent in perfume.Sage Content Propagation Basic requirements Sage is a grows best in a well draining, rich, clay loams with a pH between 6.5 and 7.0.
It should be planted in full sun, although some afternoon shade is tolerated. Sage plants require warm temperatures and ample sunlight in order to produce a high essential oil content in the leaves.Propagation Sage is usually propagated from seed, although both cuttings, divisions and air layering is also successfully practised.The planting site should be warm, dry and protected from wind.Seeds should be sown after all danger of frost has passed leaving 23 cm (9 in) between seeds.Fertilizer may be added to the soil prior to planting to aid development.Plants should be thinned to a final spacing of 45 cm (18 in).General care and maintenance Sage plants should be pruned in early Spring to promote new growth, or after flowering in the summer.In addition to an application at planting, sage will benefit from a side dressing of fertilizer 6 to 8 weeks after planting.Sage will become very woody within 3-4 years of planting and should be replaced with new plants.
Harvesting Sage is best harvested just before flowering when the essential oil content of the leaves is highest. Sage should be harvested by cutting the top 20 cm (8 in) of tender growth with a sharp knife.Commercial fields may be harvested by mowing but the highest quality product is achieved by harvesting only the leaves.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Salvia officinalis (common sage) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/48211.[Accessed 09 April 15].Paid subscription required .Copsey, K.& Lerner, B.R.(2002).Growing herbs.Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/HO-28.pdf.[Accessed 09 April 15].Free to access .

Description Crop Details The following are the crop details for sorghum: Scientific name: Sorghum bicolor Order: Poales Family: Poaceae (formerly known as Gramineae) Genus: Sorghum Local names: Swahili: mtama; Spanish: sorgo; French: sorgho; German: sorghum; Italian: sorgo; Portuguese: sorgo; Chinese (Mandarin): é«˜ç²± (gÄ​o liÃ¡ng); Japanese: ã ƒ ¢ã ƒ ​ã‚³ã‚· (morokoshi); Hindi: à¤œà¥​à¤µà¤¾à¤° (jwar); Arabic: Ø§Ù„Ø°Ø±Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙˆØ¯Ø§Ø¡ (al-dhurrah al-sawda) General Information Sorghum is a type of cereal grain that belongs to the grass family Poaceae (formerly known as Gramineae). It is one of the top five cereal crops in the world, and is widely grown in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.Sorghum is a tall, erect, annual grass that typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters.It has long, narrow leaves and produces large, compact clusters of grain on top of its stems.The grains are typically small and round, with a hard outer Sorghum Content layer that is difficult to remove.
Sorghum plants come in many different colors, including red, brown, white, and yellow, and some varieties have a sweet taste. The crop is hardy, can tolerate heat and drought, and is adapted to a wide range of soil types.It is a relatively low- maintenance crop, requiring less water and fertilizer than many other grains, which makes it an important crop for farmers in many parts of the world.Sorghum spikelet Sorghum Sorghum plants Sorghum Varieties Sorghum is a versatile crop that comes in many different varieties, each with its own unique characteristics and uses.Grain sorghum , also known as milo, is the most widely grown type and is used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production.On the other hand, sweet sorghum has a high sugar content and is used for the production of sorghum syrup, molasses, and other sweeteners.Forage sorghum , which is primarily used for animal feed, is harvested for its leaves and stalks rather than its grain.
There is also broomcorn sorghum grown for the production of brooms and brushes, which are made from the plant's long, stiff fibers. Dual-purpose sorghum , as the name suggests, is grown for both grain and forage and is used to feed both humans and animals.High-tannin sorghum , on the other hand, is grown for its high tannin content, which makes it resistant to bird and insect damage.There are many specialty varieties of sorghum that are grown for specific uses, such as ornamental purposes, traditional medicine, and cultural practices.Climatic, soil, and water conditions Sorghum is a highly adaptable crop that can grow in a variety of climatic, soil, and water conditions.However, there are certain optimal conditions for growing the crop that can maximize its yield and quality.Climate : Sorghum is a warm-season crop that requires a long growing season with high temperatures and plenty of sunshine.
It can tolerate drought, but excessive rainfall or humidity can increase the risk of diseases and reduce yield. Generally, sorghum grows well in areas with an average annual rainfall of 400â€“600 mm, although it can also be grown in areas with lower rainfall if there is access to irrigation.Soil : Sorghum can grow in a wide range of soil types, from sandy to clayey, but it prefers well-drained soils with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.It is important to have good soil fertility and adequate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for optimal growth and yield.The soil should also be free of weeds and other pests that can compete with sorghum for nutrients and water.Water : Sorghum requires adequate moisture throughout its growing season, but it is also drought-tolerant and can survive in areas with limited water availability.It is important to have a reliable water source, either through rainfall or irrigation, to ensure that sorghum has enough water to grow and develop.
However, overwatering can also be detrimental to sorghum, as it can lead to waterlogging and reduced yields. Sorghum is a highly adaptable crop that can grow in a variety of climatic, soil, and water conditions.However, there are certain optimal conditions for growing sorghum that can maximize its yield and quality.Planting Procedure The planting procedure for sorghum can vary depending on factors such as climate, soil conditions, and the specific sorghum variety being grown.However, there are some general guidelines that can help ensure the successful planting and growth of sorghum.Seed selection : Choose high-quality sorghum seeds that are adapted to your climate and soil conditions.It is important to select seeds that are disease-free and have high germination rates.Land preparation : Prepare the land by removing any weeds, rocks, or other debris that may interfere with planting.Till the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm to loosen the soil and improve drainage.
Planting time : Sorghum should be planted during the warmer months when the soil temperature has reached at least 15Â°C. The specific planting time will depend on the location and climate, but generally, sorghum is planted in the spring or early summer.Planting method : Sorghum can be planted using various methods, such as direct seeding or transplanting.Direct seeding involves planting seeds directly into the soil, while transplanting involves starting the seeds in a nursery and then transplanting the seedlings into the field.Seed spacing : Space the seeds according to the recommended spacing for your sorghum variety.Typically, sorghum seeds are planted in rows with a spacing of 60â€“75 cm between rows and 10â€“20 cm between seeds.Fertilization : Apply fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as recommended based on soil test results and the specific sorghum variety being grown.Irrigation : Provide adequate water for the seeds to germinate and establish.
The amount of water required will depend on the soil moisture level and the climate. Harvesting The harvesting procedure for sorghum can vary depending on the specific variety, climate, and soil conditions.However, there are some general steps that can help ensure a successful and efficient harvest: Determine maturity: Sorghum should be harvested when it reaches physiological maturity, which is when the seed head turns from green to yellow, brown, or red and the seeds become hard and difficult to dent.Timing : The timing of the harvest will depend on the climate and variety, but generally, sorghum is harvested during the dry season, when the seeds have matured and dried out.Equipment : Use appropriate equipment, such as a combine harvester or sickle, to harvest the sorghum.Cutting : Use a sickle or combine harvester to cut the stalks near the base of the plant.
The stalks can be cut at a height of 10-15 cm above the ground to leave some stubble for erosion control and soil conservation. Drying : Allow the sorghum to dry in the field for a few days to a week to reduce moisture content and improve storage quality.Threshing : Use a thresher or other equipment to remove the seeds from the seed head.Alternatively, the seed heads can be beaten with a stick to release the seeds.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/50633.[Accessed 13 April 23].Paid subscription required.Compendium of sorghum diseases.American Phytopathological Society Press.Available at: http://www.apsnet.org/apsstore/shopapspress/Pages/42406.aspx.Available for purchase from APS Press.Ottman, O.& Olson, O.(2009).Espinoza, L.& Kelley, J.(Eds.)

The soybean plant is usually an erect bush with woody stems and alternately arranged leaves. The leaves possess three individual leaflets which are oval or lance-like in shape, growing to a length of 3â€“10 cm (1.2â€“4.0 in).The soybean plant produces small white or purple flowers and curved seed pods which are 3â€“15 cm (1.2â€“6 in) in length and can contain between 1 and 5 seeds.The seeds can be a variety of colors including yellow, green, brown, black or a mottled combination.Soybean is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach heights of 0.2â€“1.5 m (0.7â€“1.4 ft).Soybean may also be referred to as soyabean or soya and originates from Northeast China.
Soybean ready for harvest Soybean ready for harvest Healthy soybean field Soybean pods Hairs on soybean pod Soybean flowering Soybean flowering Young cultivated soybean Soybean Soybean Content Uses Soybean seeds can be used to make flour and dairy substitutes such as milk, margarine and yogurt and meat substitutes such as veggie burgers. Oil can be extracted from both the seeds and pods and the by product of the extraction is used as an animal feed.The oil from the plant is used in products such as paint, linoleum and soap.Soybean is also grown as a cover crop and used as animal fodder or hay.Propagation Basic requirements Soybean is a short-day plant, requiring hot weather for optimum production.It can be grown year round in most parts of the tropics.Plants can be grown at ambient temperatures between 15 and 27Â°C (60â€“80Â°F) although temperature below 21Â°C (69.8Â°F) and above 32 (89.6Â°F) may reduce flowering.
Temperatures exceeding 40Â°C (104Â°F) are detrimental to seed production. Soybeans are adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and climates but require adequate soil moisture for germination and seedling establishment.Plants are sensitive to waterlogging but are tolerant of drought conditions once established.Soybean grows best on a light, loose, well draining loam with a pH of 6.5.Propagation Soybean is propagated directly from seed.If seeds are to planted in a field where soybean has not been been grown in the 3â€“5 year previous, they should first be inoculated with nitrogen fixing bacteria.The seedbed should be prepared prior to planting by removing any crop residue, weeds and large stones.Tilling the soil helps to break up large clods of earth.Seeds may be sown mechanically or by hand.in tilled soils, seeds are usually planted at a depth 3.2â€“4.5 cm (1.25 to 1.75 in) in rows spaced 30 cm (11.8 in) apart.
Alternatively, no-till planting may be used to plant seeds in the stubble of a previous crop without first cultivating the soil. With this method, seeds are drilled into the soil in rows spaced 17.8 cm (7 in) apart.No-till practices reduce soil erosion and reduces the loss of moisture in the soil.General care and maintenance Weeds are often a problem in soybean fields and can be reduced through good preparation of the seedbed and maintaining a weed-free seedbed for several weeks prior to planting.Weeds may be controlled with appropriate herbicides, where available, or through mechanical cultivation where necessary.Soybeans should be provided with irrigation at flowering and again at seed-set for maximum seed fill and optimal yield.Irrigation should be increased in sandy soils that do not retain as much moisture.Soybeans fix approximately half of the nitrogen they require for growth and the other half must be supplied from the soil or through fertilizer application.
Soybean also requires an adequate supply of phosphorus and potassium and application rates should be based on the results of a soil test. Harvesting Soybeans are ready to harvest between 70 and 160 days after planting, depending on variety.Plants are ready for harvest when the leaves and stems have turned yellow and the seed pods brown to black.Soybeans for fresh use are cut while still green.Plants may be pulled by hand or cut with the use of a combine.Once cut, the seeds are removed from the pods by threshing.Soybean seedlings References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Glycine max (soyabean) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/25400.[Accessed 10 April 15].Paid subscription required .Martin, F.W.(1998).Soybean.ECHOCommunity Technical note.Available at: http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/members.echocommunity.org/resource/collection/27A14B94-EFE8-4D8A-BB83- 36A61F414E3B/Soybean.pdf.[Accessed 10 April 15].Free to access .Nafziger, E.Soybean.

The spinach plant has simple leaves which stem from the center of the plant and measure about 2â€“30 cm (0.8â€“12.0 in) long and 1 to 15 cm (0.4â€“6.0 in) across. The leaves grow in a rosette and can appear crinkled or flat.The plant produces small yellow-green flowers which are 3â€“4 mm (0.1 in) in diameter.The flowers produce small fruit clusters which contain seeds.Spinach is an annual and survives only one growing season and can reach 30 cm (12 in) in height.Spinach originates from ancient Persia (now Iran).Red spinach leaf close-up Red spinach leaves Spinach flowers Spinach leaves Spinach Young spinach plants Uses Spinach is eaten cooked as a vegetable and contains both large amounts iron, calcium, and other essential vitamins and minerals.Spinach Content Propagation Basic requirements Spinach grows well in cool areas and can survive the first frost of temperate climates.
It will germinates and grows optimally at temperatures between 4 and 16Â°C (40â€“60Â°F) but can withstand temperatures as low as -7C (20Â°F). Spinach grows best in a well draining loamy soil with a pH between 6.4 and 6.8.It is sensitive to acidic soil and if the pH is too high, adding lime is recommended.The soil temperature should not exceed 21Â°C (70Â°F).Propagation Spinach is propagated from seed with round seeded spinach usually being sown in early spring for a summer harvest and the prickly seeded type which is usually sown in fall for harvest in winter and spring.Seeds should be planted at a depth of 1â€“2 cm (0.5â€“1 in) leaving 33â€“38 cm (13-15 in) between rows.When seedlings reach about 5 cm (2 in) in height they should be thinned out to a spacing of 8â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in) between plants.General care and maintenance Spinach requires high levels of moisture, and if rainfall is inadequate, 2.5 cm (1 in) of water should be applied every 7â€“10 days.
Spinach also has high requirements for nitrogen and potassium which should be provided by applying fertilizer based on the results of a soil test. Potassium poses little environmental risk and may be applied based on the results of a soil test.Timing of nitrogen applications vary by location as there is a risk of leaching during heavy rainfall.In the home garden, fertilizer is often not required as long as spinach is planted in a fertile soil.Harvesting Spinach leaves can be harvested as soon as they are large enough to use and may be harvested by hand or machine.Individual leaves may be harvested as required in the home garden or the whole plant can be cut.In commercial production, bunched fresh spinach is usually cut by hand.SPinach for processing may be cut by machine.References Anderson, C.R.Spinach.University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.Available at: http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/fsa-6077.pdf.[Accessed 14 April 15].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.

Vines generally have large, lobed leaves and long vines which can climb by attaching to surfaces with their tendrils. Bushes generally take up less space than the sprawling vine types and may have prickly leaves.Squash plants produce yellow or orange flowers and green, white or yellow fruit in a variety of shapes and sizes with smooth or ridged skin.Vining squash varieties can reach several meters in length and, as annuals, survive only one growing season.Squash originate from North and Central America and are referred to by their cultivar name e.g.acorn squash, butternut squash, spaghetti squash, zucchini, banana squash, hubbard squash and buttercup squash.Butternut squash Zucchini flower Galeux D'eysines squash and flower Zucchini fruit Zucchini foliage Squash blossom Squash Content Zucchini Squash leaves Yellow squash growing on vine Uses Squash fruit can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.Some varieties are grown as ornamentals.
Propagation Basic requirements Squash is a warm-season crop, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 25Â°C (65â€“75Â°F). Squash will yield best if grown in a fertile, well- draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.Squash should be planted in full sun and provided with ample soil moisture due to their shallow root system.Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space.Smaller bush varieties are available for more modest spaces.Propagation Squash is propagated from seed and can be direct seeded or sown indoors and transplanted.If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 15.6Â°C (60Â°F).Sow 1â€“2 seeds 1.3â€“2.5 cm (0.5â€“1.0 in) deep, at least 90 cm (~3 ft) apart if growing bush varieties and 120â€“150 cm (4â€“5 ft) apart if growing vining varieties.
Allow a further 1â€“3 m (6â€“10 ft) between rows depending on the variety. If transplanting, seeds should be sown 3â€“4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted before the plants develop their second set of true leaves.Seeds in sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering.Seeds should germinate in 5â€“10 days depending on the soil temperature.General care and maintenance Squash vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow.Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence.Squash also require a continuous supply of water and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water.Shallow watering or watering less frequently encourages a shallow root system.Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene mulch has the advantage of warming the soil.
All squash varieties produce both male and female flowers (monoecious) and are pollinated by insects such as bees. Harvesting Squash is ready to harvest when the rind is hard and cannot be punctured with a fingernail.The skin of mature fruits is dull and dry in appearance, especially when compared with the shiny skin of an immature fruit.Squash seedling transplanted to garden Squash seedlings in peat pots Squash plant supported by a trellis References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Cucurbita (pumpkin) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/17341.http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/17064.[Accessed 15 April 15].Paid subscription required .Heflebower, R.& Drost, D.(2010).Summer and Winter squash in the garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/HG_2004-09.pdf.[Accessed 15 April 15].Free to access .Polomski, B.(2003).Summer squash.Clemson Cooperative Extension.

Management Cucurbits should be rotated with another crop every 2 years to reduce levels of inoculum; crop debris should be removed from the field as quickly as possible after harvest or plowed deeply into the soil; applications of appropriate protective fungicides can help to slow the development of the disease; water plants from the base rather than from above to reduce periods of leaf wetness which are conducive to the development and spread of disease. Alternaria leaf spot (Brown spot) Alternaria alternata Alternaria leaf spot symptoms Symptoms Initial symptoms appear as necrotic flecks on leaves with chlorotic halos; as the disease progresses, the flecks grow into spots which may join together into large, roughly circular lesions; if infestation is severe, leaves begin to turn yellow and die.Cause Fungus Comments Pathogen survives between growing season on crop debris.
Management Crops debris should be removed from the field or plowed deeply into the soil after harvest; applications of appropriate protective fungicides can hep reduce the incidence of the disease.
Cercospora leaf spot Cercospora citrullina Symptoms Initial symptoms of disease occur on older leaves as small spots with light to tan brown centers; as the disease progresses, the lesions enlarge to cover large areas of the leaf surface; lesions may have a dark border and be surrounded by a chlorotic area; the centers of the lesions may become brittle and crack Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives on plant debris; spread by wind and water splash; occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical growing regions Management Any diseased plants should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread; crop debris should be removed after harvest or plowed deeply into the soil to reduce inoculum Downy mildew Pseudoperonospora cubensis Diseased leaf Symptoms on upper leaf surface Symptoms on lower surface of leaf Symptoms of downy mildew on underside of squash leaf Lower surface Symptoms on lower side of leaf Downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis) squash leaf Close-up of downy mildew symptoms on squash Downy mildew infected leaf Infected leaf Downy mildew symptoms on squash Downy mildew on squash foliage Symptoms Small yellow areas on the upper leaf surface; brown lesions with irregular margins; gray mold on lower leaf surface.
Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favored by moist conditions. Management Do not overcrowd plants; avoid overhead irrigation, water plants from base; apply appropriate fungicide.
Fusarium crown and foot rot Fusarium solani Symptoms Wilting of leaves progresses to wilting of entire plant and plant dies within a few days; distinctive necrotic rot of crown and upper taproot when plant is uprooted; plant breaks easily below soil line Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for 2-3 years Management Plant fungicide treated seed; rotate crops on 4 year rotation Gummy stem blight Didymella bryoniae Symptoms Brown or tan spots of various sizes on leaves; leaves covered with lesions; stems splitting and forming cankers; wounds exude a brown, gummy substance; wilting vines; death of stems Cause Fungus Comments Disease may be seed-borne Management Use disease free seed; treat seeds prior to planting; rotate crops every 2 years Powdery mildew Erysiphe cichoracearum Sphaerotheca fuliginea Podosphaera xanthii Powdery mildew symptoms on squash Powdery mildew symptoms on squash foliage Powdery mildew symptoms on squash foliage Powdery mildew on squash leaf Powdery mildew symptoms on squash Powdery mildew symptoms on squash foliage Powdery mildew symptoms on squash foliage Powdery mildew symptoms on squash Powdery mildew symptoms on squash foliage Powdery mildew symptoms on squash foliage Symptoms White powdery growth on the upper surfaces of leaves and stems; infected areas stunted and distorted.
Cause Fungi Comments Disease emergence favored by dry weather and high relative humidity. Management Plant in sites with good air circulation and sun exposure; do not overcrowd plants; sanitize equipment regularly.
Septoria leaf spot Septoria cucurbitacearum Symptoms Initial symptoms of disease are small dark water-soaked spots on the leaves which turn beige to white in dry conditions; lesions develop thin brown borders and the centers may become brittle and crack; small white spots may erupt on the surface of infected butternut and acorn squash and pumpkin fruit Cause Fungus Comments Pathogen can survive on crop debris for periods in excess of 1 year Management Scout plants during cool wet conditions for any sign of spots; early application of an appropriate protective fungicide can help limit the development of the disease if spots are found, cucurbits should be rotated with other crops every 2 years to prevent the build-up of inoculum; crop debris should be removed and destroyed after harvest Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae Symptoms Symptoms generally appear after fruit set; chlorotic leaves which develop necrotic areas; leaves collapsing; symptoms only on one side of vine; discoloration of vascular tissue in roots Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for many years; disease emergence favored by cool or mild weather in Spring Management Do not plant in areas where other susceptible crops have been grown previously; delay planting until temperatures are warmer Category : Bacterial Angular leaf spot Pseudomonas syringae Symptoms Small water-soaked lesions on leaves which expand between leaf veins and become angular in shape; in humid conditions, lesions exude a milky substance which dries to form a white crust on or beside lesions; as the disease progresses, lesions turn tan and may have yellow/green edges; the centers of the lesions dry and may drop out leaving a hole in the leaf Cause Bacterium Comments Spread through infected seed, splashing rain, insects and movement of people between plants; bacterium overwinters in crop debris and can survive for 2.5 years Management Use disease-free seed; do not grow plants in field where cucurbits have been grown in the previous 2 years; protective copper spray may help reduce incidence of disease in warm, humid climates; plant resistant varieties Bacterial leaf spot Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms Dark, angular lesions on leaves; leaf lesions may coalesce and cause severely blighted foliage; water-soaked lesions which enlarge and develop into tan scabs, or blisters, on the fruit; blisters eventually flatten as they reach their full size Cause Bacterium Comments Disease can spread rapidly in a field; disease can be introduced through contaminated seed Management Avoid overhead irrigation; rotate crops away from cucurbit species to prevent disease building up; use new seed each planting as saved seed is more likely to carry bacteria; apply appropriate protective fungicides; copper containing fungicides generally provide good control Bacterial wilt Erwinia tracheiphila Squash plant infected with bacterial wilt Symptoms of bacterial wilt on squash stem Squash plant infected with bacterial wilt Squash plant infected with bacterial wilt Strings of bacterial exudate between cut stem Symptoms Severely wilted vines; leaves appear dark green; dark discoloration on leaves and stems; rapid plant death Cause Bacterium Comments Spread by striped or spotted cucumber beetles; disease can be confirmed by cutting the stem and slowly pulling the two ends apart - infected plants will ooze strings of bacterial exudate Management Control cucumber beetle populations on plants; hand pick adult beetles and destroy; soil and foliar application of appropriate insecticides may help to control populations Category : Other Aster yellows Aster yellows phytoplasma Symptoms Foliage turning yellow; secondary shoots begin growing prolifically; stems take on a rigid, upright growth habit; leaves are often small in size and distorted, may appear thickened; flowers are often disfigured and possess conspicuous leafy bracts; fruits are small and pale in color Cause Phytoplasma Comments Disease is transmitted by leafhoppers and can cause huge losses in cucurbit crops Management Remove any infected plants from the field to reduce spread; control weeds in and around the field that may act as a reservoir for the phytoplasma; protect plants from leaf hopper vectors with row covers Blossom-end rot Symptoms Symptoms first appear on immature fruits as small light brown spots close to the blossom end of the fruit; as fruit grow, the spots enlarge, resulting in dark leathery lesions sunken into the fruit Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Management Blossom-end rot is caused by a lack of calcium in the developing fruit and it occurs when the uptake of nutrients to the plant is disrupted; factors which disrupt nutrient uptake include drought, root damage or high soil salinity; application of excess nitrogen fertilizer may also contribute to the development of blossom-end rot as it promotes vigorous growth of vegetative tissues and depletion of calcium in the soil; watering plants evenly and regularly reduces the incidence of blossom-end rot Category : Viral Cucumber mosaic Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Symptoms Plants are severely stunted; foliage is covered in distinctive yellow mosaic; leaves of plant curl downwards and leaf size is smaller than normal; flowers on infected plants may be deformed with green petals; fruits become distorted and are small in size; fruit is often discolored.
Cause Virus Comments Transmitted by aphids; virus has an extensive host range; can be mechanically transmitted via tools etc. Management Control of the virus is largely dependant on the control of the aphid vectors; reflective mulches can deter aphid feeding; aphid outbreaks can be treated with mineral oils or insecticidal soap applications; some resistant varieties are available.Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) Genus: Crinivirus Group: "Positive sense ssRNA viruses" Symptoms The symptoms generally appear on the older leaves first.Initially the symptom appears as chlorotic spotting which leads to intervenial chlorosis and followed by severe yellowing.The infected leaves may roll upward and become brittle.Also the infected plant may appear stunted.Cause Virus Comments The virus is mainly transmitted by whitefly Bemisia tabaci .The host range is restricted to the Cucurbitaceae (watermelon, melon, cucumber, squash, courgette etc.,).
Management Grow virus free and whiteflies free seed materials. During the growing season use yellow sticky traps to monitor and control whiteflies.Remove the infected plants and burn them.Keep the field free from weeds.In case severe infestation of whiteflies, use suitable insecticides.After a growing season remove the crop debris, volunteer plants and destroy them.
Squash mosaic Squash mosaic virus (SqMV) Symptoms of squash mosaic on fruit Symptoms of squash mosaic virus on leaves Symptoms Symptoms vary with variety being grown but plants can show symptoms which include include green veinbanding, mottled leaves, blisters, ring spots or potruding veins at leaf margins; some squash varieties may develop leaf enations; infected plants are often stunted and fruits may be malformed with mottled skin Cause Virus Comments Virus can be transmitted through infected seed and spread by striped cucumber beetles Management Use only certified disease-free seed Watermelon mosaic Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) Symptoms Symptoms vary widely depending on species, cultivar, virus strain and environmental conditions; symptoms on leaves may include green mosaic patternation, green vein-banding, chlorotic rings and disfigured leaves; infected fruits may develop green spots - particularly if fruit is yellow Cause Virus Comments Virus is found in almost all Cucurbit growing regions in the world; virus is spread by over 20 aphid species Management Use of resistant varieties can greatly reduce virus incidence; treatments that control populations of aphid vectors can also reduce the incidence of the virus; spraying plants with mineral oils or insecticidal soaps can help to reduce aphid numbers Zucchini yellow mosaic Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) Symptoms Infected plants are severely stunted and leaves can exhibit a variety of symptoms including yellow mosaic patternation, severe deformation, blistering, reduced size and necrosis; fruits are deformed Cause Virus Comments DIsease can cause devastating epidemics when present Management Use of resistant varieties, where available, is usually the most effective method of controlling the virus; control of aphid populations on the plants can be achieved through the use of mineral oils and insecticidal soaps but is rarely effective at controlling the virus Category : Oomycete Phytophthora crown and root rot Phytophthora capsici Rotting crown of yellow summer squash infected with Phytophthora Dark discoloration of stem Phytophthora symptoms on pattapan squash Squash plant showing symptoms of wilt caused by Phytophthora root and crown rot Wilted foliage of squash caused by Phytophthora infection Symptoms Sudden and permanent wilting of plant; leaves do not change color; plant death within a few days; roots and stem close to soil line discolored light to dark brown; plant easily removed from soil Cause Oomycete Comments Fungus can be spread through air; disease emergence favors high temperatures and water saturated soil Management Efficient management of water to avoid saturated soil; avoid long periods of irrigation Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Peach aphid, Melon aphid) Myzus persicae Aphis gossypii Aphid colony on underside of gourd leaf Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insects Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Armyworms (Beet armyworm, Western striped armyworm) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera praefica Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully Cucumber beetles (Western striped cucumber beetle, Western spotted cucumber beetle, Banded cucumber beetle) Acalymma vittata Diabrotica undecimpunctata Diabrotica balteata Striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) adults mass on squash leaf Striped cucumber beetle larval tunneling of base of winter squash Banded cucumber beetle (Diabrotica balteata) adult Striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) larval tunneling of base of squash plant striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) adults and damaged leaf Spotted cucumber beetle Symptoms Stunted seedling; damaged leaves, stems and/or petioles; reduced plant stand; plants may exhibit symptoms of bacterial wilt; scars on fruit caused by beetle feeding damage; adult beetles are brightly colored with either a green- yellow background and black spots or alternating black and yellow stripes.
Cause Insect Comments Beetles overwinter in soil and leaf litter and emerge from soil when temperatures begin to reach and exceed 12.7Â°C (55Â°F). Management Monitor new planting regularly for signs of beetle; floating row covers can be used to protect the plants from damage but will need to be removed at bloom to allow bees to pollinate plants; applications of kaolin clay can be effective for management of small beetle populations; application of appropriate insecticides may be necessary.Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm feeding on plant stem Cutworm larva severing plant stem Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed. Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato.
Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically. Flea beetles Epitrix spp.
Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance. Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied. Leaf miners Lyriomyza spp.
Leafminer damage on squash leaf Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow fly which lays its eggs in the leaf; larave hatch and feed on leaf interior Cause Insect Comments Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 10 generations per year Management Check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest; only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies Squash bug Anasa tristis Squash bug damage Squash bugs on plant causing wilting leaves Squash bug nymphs Squash bug eggs on underside of squash leaf Adult squash bug Symptoms Speckled leaves which turn yellow and brown; wilting plants; dieback of runners; blemished fruit; fruit death; adult squash bugs are often misidentified as stink bugs; they are grey-black in color with orange and black stripes on the edges of their abdomen; nymphs are greenish gray in color and often covered in white powder; female squash bugs lay conspicuous copper colored eggs on the undersides of the leaves Cause Insect Comments Squash bugs overwinter in crop debris or under rocks and stones Management Destroy all crops residue as soon as possible after harvest or on plant death; apply row covers at planting; apply insecticidal soap or appropriate insecticide Squash vine borer Melittia cucurbitae Squash vine borer damage at base of squash plant; larva visible Damage to squash vine by squash vine borer Symptoms Wilting plants; holes in vines or at base of petioles; green frass (insect excrement) visible around holes Cause Insect Comments Insect overwinters in soil as larvae or pupae and adults emerge in spring; adults lay eggs on leaves and larvae burrow intro stems to feed Management Apply appropriate insecticide if eggs are found on leaves; plow plants into soil after harvest Stinkbugs (Various) Various Brown stink bug Symptoms Dark colored pinpricks on fruit surrounded by a lighter area that turns yellow or remains light green; stink bugs often carry pathogens in their mouthparts which can cause secondary infections and decay of fruit; adult insect is shield- shaped and brown or green in color; may have pink, red or yellow markings; eggs are drum shaped and laid in clusters on the leaves; larvae resemble the adults but are smaller Cause Insect About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Comments Adult insects overwinter under leaves, on legumes, blackberries or on certain weeds such as mustard or Russian thistle Management Remove weeds around crop which may act as overwintering sites for stink bugs and practice good weed management throughout the year; organically accepted control methods include the use of insecticidal soaps, kaolin clay and preservation of natural enemies; chemical treatments are not recommended for tomatoes that are to be processed for paste or canning unless secondary infections with other pathogens are a concern Thrips (Western flower thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Western flower thrips Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description The Carambola tree, Averrhoa carambola , is a woody plant in the family Oxalidaceae grown for its fruit known as starfruit.
Carambola trees are small, bushy evergreens with drooping branches. The tree possesses soft compound leaves composed of 2â€“5 leaflets which are green in color and arranged in a spiral around the branches.Each leaf is 15â€“20 cm (5.9â€“7.9 in) long and each leaflet 3.8â€“9 cm (1.5â€“3.5 in) long.The leaflets are oval or ovate in shape.The tree produces small lilac or purple flowers and The waxy fruit is orange-yellow in color, 7.5â€“12.5 cm (3.0â€“4.9 in) in length, oval and deeply ribbed.The Carambola tree has a lifespan of 40 years and reaches a height of 7â€“10 m (22â€“33 ft), spreading 6â€“7.6 m (20â€“25 ft) in diameter.Carambola may also be referred to as averrhoa, starfruit, five corner or coromandel gooseberry and originates from Southeast Asia.

The fruit is also used in relishes or as a seasoning.Propagation Basic requirements Carambola is a tropical to subtropical tree which grows best in warm to hot temperatures between 20 and 35Â°C (68â€“95Â°F).Trees will generally cease to grow at temperatures below 18.3Â°C (65Â°F) although established trees can withstand short periods at -2.8Â°C (27Â°F).Carambola can be grown successfully in many soil types, from heavy clay to sandy soils but will perform optimally in a rich, well-draining loam with a pH between 4.5 to 7.0 Trees will not tolerate waterlogging but do require a moist soil for optimum production.
Propagation Carambola is commonly grown from seed although veneer grafting onto suitable rootstock yields the best results for commercial production. Seeds only remain viable for a few days and should be plump and fully developed for propagation.Seeds should be planted in a well-draining potting media such as peat moss and will germinate in approximately 7 days depending on temperature.Once seeds have germinated, they should be transplanted into individual containers containing sandy loam soil.The seedlings should be kept in these containers until they are transplanted.Carambola trees should be planted in full sun and spaced 9 m (30 ft) apart.General care and maintenance Carambola trees require moist soil for optimum production.Young trees should be irrigated regularly after planting to promote establishment in the soil.Older trees should be watered regularly from flowering to fruit set.
A layer of mulch around the trees will help to conserve moisture in the soil but should not be mounded up against the trunks. Young carambola will benefit from applications of fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and magnesium every 30 to 60 days.Established, mature trees should be fertilized 4 to 6 times per year.Young trees should be pruned in the first 1â€“2 years after planting by cutting the tips off of branches which are greater than 60â€“90 cm (2â€“3 ft) in length to encourage branching.Older trees should be pruned to maintain a manageable height.Harvesting Carambola fruit does not ripen off the tree and should be harvested when fully mature.Fruits are ready to harvest when they have turned from green to yellow in color, with the tips of the ribs remaining green.Fully ripe fruit naturally fall from the tree but can be picked earlier if desired.References Crane, J.H.(2007).Carambola growing in the Florida home landscape.University of Florida IFAS Extension.

Strawberry is an herbaceous perennial in the family Rosaceae. The plant has a short stem and trifoliate leaves which form a crown.close to the ground.The leaves display a variety of characteristic depending on the species, some are evergreen whereas some have leaves that will die and fall off in winter.The plant produces flower stalks from the crown and the the flowers are white in color.The fruit of the plant is red and fleshy with small seeds on the outside.Strawberry can grow 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) in height and has an economic life of 2â€“4 years before the plants are replaced.Strawberry may also be referred to as garden strawberry and the plant is grown in most northern temperate regions of the world.The first domestic hybrids were created in Europe.

Propagation Basic requirements Strawberries grow very well in cool temperate climates, at temperatures below 30Â°C (86Â°F)and require at least 8 hours of sunlight per day.They can be grown successfully in a wide variety of soils from sandy soils to silty clay but will grow best in a deep, well draining loam rich in organic matter.The optimum pH for their growth is between 5.5 and 6.5.If drainage is poor then it is recommended to plant strawberry on beds raised by a minimum of 15â€“20 cm (6â€“8 in).
Strawberry varieties Strawberries generally fall into 3 categories: June-bearing Evergreen Day-neutral June-bearing plants commonly produce large fruits, and, as their name suggests, will produce a crop of fruit over a 2â€“3 week period around June. Evergreen strawberry varieties produce two (and sometimes 3) crops of fruit per year in spring and late summer or early fall.Day-neutral strawberry varieties will give you fruit in the first year, generally produce smaller fruits but will produce whenever the temperature is between 1.6â€“29Â°C (35â€“85Â°F).Propagation Seeds It is generally considered to be more difficult to start strawberry plants from seed than it is to work with young plants.Depending on the variety of strawberry you have chosen, it may be necessary to cold treat your seeds before germination.This can be achieved by simply placing them in the freezer for 2â€“4 weeks before sowing.
Strawberry seeds should be sown in trays containing a good quality, sterile seed starting mix. Sow the seeds to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in) and keep the soil moist (but not wet) while the seeds germinate.Seeds should germinate in 2â€“3 weeks.When the seedlings reach 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1-2 in) in height, thin the seedlings if they are too close together and repot or transplant to the garden when they have 3 leaves.If planting outside be sure to harden the seedlings off before you put them in the ground.Runners Strawberries produce offspring on a sideshoot known as a â€œrunnerâ€​.Runners can be removed from the mother plant and relocated.Simply plant the runners to the desired final spacing in a bed prepared similarly to planting seeds.Planting Begin preparing the strawberry bed as early as possible in the Spring when the soil becomes workable.Prepare the soil for planting by adding organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure.
Plant the strawberry transplants 38â€“60 cm (15â€“24 in) apart depending on variety and allow 90â€“120 cm (36â€“48 in) between rows. Be careful to plant so that the crown of the plant (the point from which the leaves emerge) is at the soil surface.If planted too deep, the plants may rot and if planted too shallow the plants may not take root.After planting, water the plants thoroughly.General care and maintenance In the first growing season after planting, the plants should not be allowed to produce fruit in order for the plants to concentrate their energy of vegetative growth.Pinch off any flowers as they are produced.Fruit can be harvested in the year after planting.When the desired density of plants is reached cut off any runners or cultivate with a hoe.Weeds should also be removed from the strawberry bed regularly.Strawberry plants also require adequate moisture and should receive 2.5â€“3.8 cm (1â€“1.5 in) of water per week either from rainfall or irrigation if needed.
Strawberries will benefit from the addition of mulch which helps to conserve soil moisture and protects the plants from late frosts in Spring. If frost is forecast after planting the plants should be protected with row covers or other suitable material.Plants can also be protected with sprinkler irrigation.Row covers can also be used to protect the fruit from birds when fruiting.Harvesting Fruit should be harvested regularly (every other day) when it is being produced by picking the berry along with the cap and 0.5 in of stem.remove the berries by pinching the stem.Harvest only fully ripe strawberries as they will not ripen further after harvest.Strawberry schematic showing runner References Bordelon, B.(2001).Growing strawberries.Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/ho-46.pdf.[Accessed 15 April 15].Free to access .Maas, J.L.(Ed.)

Management Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g. Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers.
Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Peach aphid, Potato aphid, Melon aphid, Strawberry aphid) Myzus persicae Macrosiphon euphorbiae Aphis gossypii Chaetosiphon fragaefolii Adult and nymphs of cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) Strawberry aphid Winged green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) adult Adult potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) with young nymphs, in the act of giving birth to another nymph. Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants.
Cause Insects Comments Aphids transmit several viruses which can be very damaging to strawberry, the insects rarely reach a high enough population to cause severe damage directly but the spread of viruses is a major concern in strawberry production. Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Armyworm (Beet army worm, southern armyworm) Spodoptera exigua Spodoptera eridania Adult southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania) Southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania) larvae feeding on strawberry leaf Beet armyworm larva Southern armyworm damaged strawberry leaves Adult beet armyworm -Gray forewings with a white or pinkish spot, whit hind wings, and small size distinguish this species.
Larvae of southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania) Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) larvae Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3â€“5 generations a year.
Management Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae. Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Japanese beetles Japanese beetles Japanese beetles and damage on strawberry plants Symptoms Leaves skeletonized (only veins remaining); flowers and buds damaged; plant damage may be extensive; adult insect is a metallic green-bronze beetle with tufts of white hair protruding from under wing covers on each side of the body; adult beetles are approximately 13 mm in length; larvae are cream-white grubs which develop in the soil.
Cause Insect Comments One beetle generation every 1-2 years; pheromone traps may actually attract more beetles to home gardens and should generally be avoided; beetle overwinters as larvae in soil; beetle has an extensive range of over 300 host plants. Management If beetles were a problem in the previous year, use floating row covers to protect plants or spray kaolin clay; adult beetles can be hand picked from plants and destroyed by placing in soapy water; parasitic nematodes can be applied to soil to reduce the number of overwintering grubs; insecticidal soaps or neem oil can help reduce beetle populations.Loopers (Cabbage looper) Trichoplusia ni Cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) adult moth Cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) larvae Cabbage looper Cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) egg Early instar larvae of cabbage looper Cabbage loopers early instar larvae Cocoon and pupa of the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) from which the moth has emerged.

The leaves of the plant grow from the nodes of the stem, arranged in two rows on either side of the stem. The leaves are tubular and blade-like, thicker in the centres than at the margins and encircle the stem.The inflorescence of sugarcane is a terminal panicle which possesses two spikelets and seeds protected by husks (glumes) covered in silky hair.Two flowers are produced on the inflorescence, one sterile and the other bisexual.Sugarcane can reach a height of up to 6 m (3.3 ft) and once harvested, the stalk will regrow allowing the plant to live for between 8 and 12 years.Sugarcane may also be referred to as nobel cane and originates from New Guinea.Harvested sugarcane Sugarcane Sugarcane flowering Uses Sugarcane is primarily used for the production of cane sugar (sucrose).One of the biproducts of sugarcane production is bioethanol which can be used as a fuel in place of gasoline.
The dried fibre which is left over after the extraction of the sugarcane juice is called bagasse and is used in paper and textile production, as a fuel or as an organic mulch. Sugarcane Content Propagation Basic requirements Sugarcane grows best in tropical and subtropical regions as the plants require a warm, sunny and moist environment for growth.Plants will grow optimally at temperatures between 26 and 33Â°C (78.8â€“91.4Â°F) where there are no frosts which will damage the plants.Sugarcane can be grown successfully in a variety of soils but will perform optimally in deep, well-draining soils, rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.0 and 8.0.Sugarcane requires an average annual rainfall of between 1800 and 2500 mm per year for adequate growth.If rainfall is too low, plants should be grown with irrigation to maximize yield.Propagation Sugarcane is vegetatively propagated by planting part of a mature cane called â€œsettsâ€​.Setts should be cut from carefully selected mature canes.
A few days before the cuttings are taken, the end of the canes are removed to break the apical dominance of the cane and promote the breaking of buds. The best cuttings are taken from the upper portions of the cane and should be approximately 40 cm (16 in) in length with 2â€“3 buds.Sugarcane setts should be planted horizontally or at a 45Â° angle in furrows 15â€“30 cm (6â€“12 in) deep.Once in the ground, the setts should be covered with a thin layer of soil.Setts can be grown in a nursery bed and transplanted to the field or planted directly at the final growing site.The average planting density for sugarcane is 15,000â€“24,000 cuttings per hectare of land.Normally furrow method of planting is followed.A new method called pit method of planting promises two to three times more yield and more ratoon (up to 10) compared to furrow method.General care and maintenance Plantations should be kept free from weeds with weeding being carried out every 3â€“4 weeks.
Weeds can be removed by hand or through the use of machinery or appropriate chemicals. If rainfall is not sufficient to meet the growth requirements of the plants then irrigation must be supplied every 2â€“4 weeks through furrow or sprinkler irrigation.Soil should be mounded up around the base of the canes 1â€“2 times during the growing season to promote good root development, aid drainage in heavy soil or prevent lodging in light soils.Harvesting Sugarcane is most commonly harvested by hand cutting Stalks should be cut close to the ground with a sharp knife when the canes are fully mature.Reference Baucum, L., Rice, R.W.& Muralles, L.(2009).Backyard sugarcane.University of Florida IFAS Extension.Available at: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/SC/....[Accessed 16 April 15].Free to access.CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2012).Saccharum officinarum (sugarcane) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/48160.[Accessed 16 April 15].Paid subscription required.Verheye, W.

The plant has a thick, hairy, erect stem which gives rise to a large flower head.The plant has large, broad lower leaves which are oval and arranged alternately on the stem and smaller, narrower upper leaves which are attached individually to the stem.The flower head is a large disc reaching 10â€“30 cm (4â€“12 in) in diameter which is made up of 16â€“30 individual florets which are yellow-gold in color.
The outer florets are sterile and produce the outer petals of the flower head, while the inner florets will mature into the seeds in the central disc. Sunflowers are annual plants, harvested after one growing season and can reach 1â€“3.5 m (3.3â€“11.5 ft) in height.Sunflower may also be referred to as girasole and originates from North America.Sunflower foliage Back of flower Field of sunflowers Sunflower head close-up Sunflower seeds Developing flower head Sunflowers Sunflower close-up A field of sunflowers Sunflower Content Uses Sunflower seeds can be eaten either fresh or cooked or used to extract oil which is widely used in cooking.The seeds are commonly harvested for bird seeds.Sunflowers are often grown as ornamental plants due to their large, attractive flower head.Propagation Requirements Sunflowers are generally very easy to grow and thrive in areas with long hot summers which promote flowering.They grow best at temperatures between 21 and 25.5Â°C (70â€“78Â°F).
Sunflowers can be very large and require plenty of space although there are some varieties which have been specially bred to be compact for growing in smaller spaces or for growing in containers. Sunflowers will grow in a variety of soils as long as they are not waterlogged and can be grown successfully at a pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.5.A pH above 6.0 is not recommended.They should be grown in an area that receives full sunlight and it is preferable to provide them with some shelter from wind which can damage the stems e.g.along a fence or wall.Sunflowers originate from the dry prairie regions of North America and are drought resistant once established.Their easy to grow nature makes them ideal plants for growing with children.Planting Sunflowers are most easily grown by direct seeding outdoors.In areas with a long growing season, they should be planted in late Spring after all danger of frost and when the soil has warmed through.
However, in areas with short growing seasons, the seeds can be planted a week or two before the last frost date as the plants are tolerant to cold Prepare the soil for planting by digging to loosen the soil and break up any large clumps. Plant seeds 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) deep and space them 10â€“15 cm (3â€“4 in) apart.If planting in rows, allow 0.75 m (~30 in) between each one.An application of a balanced fertilizer at planting promotes the development of a strong root system.The seeds should sprout in 7â€“10 days.When the seedlings are about 15 cm (6 in) tall with two pairs of true leaves, thin the plants to a final within row spacing of 60 cm (2 ft).Sow more seeds every 2â€“3 weeks for a continuous bloom over the summer.General care Although sunflowers are drought resistant, frequent, deep watering promotes the development of a strong root system.The plants do not require fertilizing, indeed, addition of nitrogen promotes vegetative growth and will delay flowering.
The stems of the plants can easily reach in excess of 1.8 m (6 ft) in height and will benefit from some support. Bamboo stakes work well.Harvesting Sunflowers are ready to harvest when the back of the flowers begin to turn yellow and the flower head droops.Cut the stem about 5 cm (2 in) below the head and hang up to dry in a warm, well ventilated place for several weeks.When the heads are thoroughly dried, remove the seeds with a brush or by hand.Allow the seeds to dry out for a further few days before storing.References Darby, H.& Halteman, P.(2011).Sunflower.University of Vermont Extension.Available at: http://northerngraingrowers.org/wp-content/uploads/Sunflower.pdf.[Accessed 16 April 15].Free to access .Lee, C.(2014).Sunflower for seed.University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service and University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food and Environment.Available at: http://www.uky.edu/Ag/NewCrops/introsheets/sunflower.pdf.[Accessed 16 April 15].Free to access .Myers, R.L.

Cultivated mainly in small-scale subsistence farming in East Africa, sweet potatoes are gradually gaining recognition among other indigenous foods. Its tubers are usually white, red, or purple, and increasingly, yellow-fleshed types are garnering popularity due to their high sugar, vitamin A, and lower dry matter content.Consumed either boiled or roasted, often accompanying milk, porridge, soups, or meat, they contribute significantly to diet diversity.Moreover, their young leaves, high in protein and essential vitamins like B1, B2, and folic acid, serve as a nutritious green vegetable.The vines also double as a fodder crop, providing a nutritious feed, especially during the dry season.This remarkable plant, thus, goes beyond being a mere staple, offering considerable nutritional and agronomic advantages.Uses Sweet potato tubers are consumed raw as a vegetable or processed into flour or starch.The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.
Varieties Sweet potato varieties offer diverse benefits, ranging from yield and performance to culinary value and pest tolerance, with each possessing unique characteristics that reduce the risk of agricultural failure. The different varieties cater to various regional needs and are primarily grown in East Africa for subsistence farming, contributing not only to food diversity but also as a vital fodder crop during dry seasons.Red-skinned varieties with cream flesh are popular across most regions of Kenya for their high yield.Additionally, the wide range of cultivars extends from the standard white, red, and purple types to the increasingly popular yellow-fleshed ones.The latter are particularly celebrated for their high sugar and vitamin A content, and lower dry matter composition, making them a powerful tool in fighting vitamin A deficiency in children.
Beyond their tubers, sweet potato plants provide young leafy shoots high in protein, approximately 20% of dry weight, and rich in b-carotene, thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (B2), folic acid, and ascorbic acid. These nutrient-rich leaves are often consumed as vegetables, thereby enhancing the plant's versatility and nutritional contribution.With each variety catering to different needs, sweet potatoes continue to gain popularity and form a critical part of the food and agricultural landscape Climate conditions, soil, and water management Climate conditions, soil, and water management Sweet potato thrives in sunny conditions but can manage with 30-50% less sunlight.For optimal growth, it prefers an annual rainfall of 600-1600 mm, evenly distributed throughout the growing season.However, dry periods can encourage the growth of storage roots.Despite its drought tolerance, extended dry spells, particularly during planting or root development, can significantly reduce yields.
Soil management, especially maintaining organic matter, is crucial for water retention in rain-fed crops. Organic matter and plant mulches help soil retain moisture, reduce surface evaporation, and prevent soil crusting.They also enhance rainwater absorption.Weeds, competing for water, should be regularly removed and can be used as additional mulch.Where irrigation is feasible, the aim should be to maintain consistent soil moisture.Watering should sufficiently wet the root zone without causing deep drainage or runoff.Overwatering can lead to nutrient leaching and contamination of water sources.Light-textured soils require more frequent, lesser amounts of irrigation to avoid runoff losses.Post cultivation, the land is usually fashioned into ridges, or mounds for those working manually.However, in well-drained soils, flat fields are also possible.Ridges on sloping land should align with contours to reduce erosion and increase rainwater absorption.
They should be higher in wet areas for better soil drainage. Propagation and planting Sweet potatoes can be planted at any time if there is no critical dry season.Planting early in the rainy season is best in regions with a critical dry season.If the rainy season is long and wet, it is usually planted near the end.Sweet potato planting material is obtained from either vine cuttings, which is the most common source, or storage roots.Plant cuttings should be planted at approximately 15 x 20 cm spacing if planting material is to be kept in a multiplication plot before planting the next crop.After 45 days, new growth may be ready for cutting.Planting Use of stem cuttings: Farmers obtain mature crop cuttings before or shortly after harvesting storage roots.The cuttings are either used to establish a maintenance field or planted directly into the next sweet potato crop.The following factors influence yield when using stem cuttings: Choosing 'clean' planting material is critical.
This includes removing any insects, soil, or signs of virus or fungal disease from the cuttings. In general, the apical (tip) portion of the vine is superior to the middle or basal portions.This portion has been shown to establish faster than other portions and is less likely to be infested with sweet potato weevils and fungal pathogens.For cultivars with long vines, the second or third cut is sufficient.If vine growth has been so rapid that the stem has not matured in the apical portion, the second cutting may be superior to the tip portion.The number of nodes is more important than the length of the cut.The average size is 20-40 cm, with 5-8 nodes.Field conditions may influence the relationship between cutting length and crop development.Farmers should experiment to see what length works best for their specific situation.Usually, one-third to two-thirds of the cutting is buried.A minimum of 2-3 nodes, but up to approximately 8 nodes, are placed beneath the soil.
The time between cutting and planting may affect yield depending on the storage conditions for the cuttings. Storing cuttings in humid conditions for one to two days may encourage node rooting.Longer storage may be detrimental to the establishment due to the depletion of the cuttings' energy reserves.To reduce losses, remove the leaves from the lower portion of the cutting and store bundles of cuttings in a cool, shady, wind-free location wrapped in a wet cloth or sack.If roots form during storage, they must be carefully planted to avoid root damage.Use of storage roots: Storage roots are used while there are inadequate stem cuttings available or when pest and disease infestation is so severe that only a few healthy vines remain.Since the sprouts can be harvested mechanically from the seedbed, they can also be used in highly mechanized production.Healthy storage roots should be selected from high-yielding plants.
The roots are densely planted in a seedbed far from different candy potato crops. To help retain moisture, the roots are covered with about 3 cm of soil, and the bed is covered with straw.When the sprouts have grown effectively, they are cut near their base and planted in the field.To increase the number of cuttings, remove the sprout tips when they are about 20 cm long to promote branching.Rapid seed multiplication: Rapid multiplication can be used when a large number of cuttings are required.Although sweet potato growers have not fully acknowledged the value of this practice, it may be the simplest way to produce a large number of planting materials.The following steps are involved in this method: 30 cm cuttings are taken from established plants or sprouted storage roots.These are then cut into single-node cuttings with the attached leaf.The vine's tip is discarded.A seedbed is produced by mixing loose, humus-rich soil with ash.
Plant the single-node cuttings densely, with the stem section buried and the leaf upright. The seedbed is watered on a regular basis and kept moist, especially during the first week of the establishment.When the seedlings have developed enough roots, they should be transplanted into the field after about 2 weeks.To avoid damaging the roots, they should be carefully removed from the seedbed.To avoid excessive evaporation and wilting, transplanting should be done in the late afternoon.Degeneration of planting material When the sweet potato is vegetatively propagated for several generations, yield decline is common.This is usually due to a virus buildup, many of which have no obvious symptoms.This frequently gives the impression that a new variety (carrying few viruses) yields significantly higher than traditional varieties, when in fact it may not be any better after a year or two of virus accumulation.
Heat treatment and meristem culture (from research institutions) can be used to remove viruses. Depending on the severity of the original virus infestation, this process typically results in a yield increase of 20 to 200% for both vines and roots.The higher yield may be maintained in the field for several years before the virus load has built up.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/28783.[Accessed 16 April 15].Paid subscription required .Collins, W.W.(1995).Sweet potato.Purdue University Center for New Crops and Plant Products.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/cropfactsheets/sweetpotato.html.[Accessed 16 April 15].Free to access .Lerner, B.R.(2001).The sweet potato.Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/ho-136.pdf.[Accessed 16 April 15].Free to access .Wright, S.(2014).Sweet potato.

The size and spacing of mounds are determined by soil conditions. They can be planted 75-200 cm apart and with several cuttings per mound.Although some farmers plant two cuttings at each mound, there is little evidence that this is beneficial.Single cuttings are said to produce a higher proportion of large storage roots.Husbandry Weed infestation is a problem in the first two months of growth and requires adequate control to ensure high yield.Following that, the vines' vigorous growth effectively covers the ground and smothers weeds.Manual weeding is commonly used in the tropics.Sweet potato responds well to fertilization, especially if the land has been cropped continuously.However, fertilizer is rarely used in the tropics.To improve soil fertility, manure or good compost should be added.This is a common practice among smallholders and traditional farmers.Around the world, sweet potato is used in a wide range of cropping systems.
Rotating sweet potato with other crops such as rice, legumes, and maize is beneficial for disease, pest, and weed control. Harvesting The harvesting season for sweet potato storage roots is not well defined; it varies depending on the cultivar, cultural practices, and climate.In tropical countries where sweet potatoes are grown for domestic consumption, 'progressive harvesting' (piece-meal harvesting) is common practice.To avoid weevil damage, it is generally recommended to harvest within 4 months.Manual harvesting with implements such as a stick, spade, or hoe is common in the tropics.Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Alternaria leaf spot & Leaf and stem blight Alternaria spp.

reduced yield; circular dark brown, corky lesions on tubers which are V-shaped in cross section; cracked and distorted tubers which resemble dumbells; rotting feeder roots Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors light, sandy soils Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is through the use of resistant varieties of sweet potato; if resistant varieties are not being used then the soil should be maintained at a low pHwhich is unfavorable to the pathogen; sweet potato should be rotated with other crops which are non-hosts to prevent build up of the pathogen in the soil; fumiigation of the soil prior to planting can be an effective method of reducing the severity of the disease Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) Symptoms Sweet potato virus disease is a disease complex caused by two viruses; sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV).
The symptoms are sever stunting of infected plants, stunting, distorted and chlorotic mottle or vein clearing of the leaves. It is confirmed that SPCSV enhances the accumulation of SPFMV.The symptoms caused by SPCSV alone is negligible.Where as symptoms caused by SPFMV is localized, mild and often asymptomatic and won't cause significant damage to the plant.Common symptom include appearance of feathery, purple patterns on the leaves.Cause Virus Comments It is estimated that SPVD causes yield loss up to 80 - 90%.The disease was first reported in 1939 from eastern Belgian Congo (present Democratic Republic of Congo).SPCSV is crinivirus of Closterviridae and SPFMV is potyvirus belong to Potyviridae.SPFMV is transmitted by a wide range of aphid species.SPCSV is transmitted by white flies (Bemisia tabaci).Management Use healthy cuttings for planting.Remove the infected plants and burn them.Follow crop rotation.Spray suitable insecticides to control aphids and white flies.

The tarragon plant is erect with slender, often branching stems and simple needle-like leaves which are glossy green and very aromatic.The plant produces a drooping head at the end of the stem which contains up to 40 yellow-green florets.Tarragon can reach a height of 1.5 m (5 ft) and can live for many years, dying back in the Winter and regrowing in Spring.Tarragon may be referred to by their cultivar group and these include French tarragon and Russian Tarragon.The origin of the plant is unknown but it has a wide distribution which covers Europe, parts of Asia and North America.
Tarragon plant Tarragon seedheads Tarragon Uses Tarragon leaves are used either fresh or dried as a culinary herb. Essential oil can be extracted from the leaves and flowers.Tarragon Content Propagation Basic requirements Tarragon grows best in temperate climates and can survive some light frost.Tarragon will perform optimally when planted in a dry location in full sun.Soil should be light in texture and well-draining, with a pH between 6.3 and 7.5.Plants tend to perform better in slightly acidic soils.Tarragon will not tolerate wet soil and requires only 300 to 1300 mm of rainfall annually.Propagation Tarragon is usually vegetatively propagated from stem or rhizome cuttings.Stem cuttings should be 15 cm (6 in) in length and taken from the shoot tip.Use of a rooting hormone will aid tarragon rooting.Root cuttings should be 5 cm (2 in) in length and should be taken together with a new shoot.
Beds should be prepared for planting by incorporating organic matter and an all purpose fertilizer, if desired, into the soil. This should be worked into the top 15â€“20 cm (8â€“10 in) of the soil to provide nutrients and improve soil aeration.Tarrago should be planted in Spring after all danger of frost and newly rooted plants should be planted 25 cm (10 in) apart allowing 25â€“40 cm (10â€“16 in) between rows.General care and maintenance In commercial tarragon production, it is common to mulch fresh plantings with straw to conserve moisture in the soil, suppress weeds and lower the soil temperature.Tarragon roots are tender and this helps them to establish in the soil.Tarragon should be watered regularly bu soil should be allowed to dry out between irrigations.Plants do not require the addition of any fertilizer as the flavor is improved by growing in nutrient poor soil.Tarragon should be pruned regularly to promote branching.
Harvesting In the home garden, sprigs of tarragon can be harvested as required by pinching 1/3 of the length of the stem. Commercially produced tarragon is first harvested about 2 months after transplanting when the plants are well established.Plants are harvested 2â€“3 times over the growing season by cutting the tender tops.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Artemisia dracunculus (tarragon) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/7089.[Accessed 17 April 15].Paid subscription required .Herb Society of America (2003).Tarragon.An Herb Society of America Fact Sheet.Available at: http://www.herbsociety.org/factsheets/tarragon.pdf.[Accessed 17 April 15].Free to access .Hudson, B.& Drost, D.(2009).French tarragon in the garden.Utah State University Cooperative Extension.Available at: https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/Horticulture_Garden_2009-02.pdf.[Accessed 17 April 15].Free to access .

The tea plant is branching with alternate elliptical leaves. The leaves are leathery in texture, matte green in color and have serrated edges.The tea plant can take the form of a tree with a bowl-shaped canopy but is usually pruned under cultivation to be smaller and shrub-like.The plant produces fragrant white flower singly or in small clusters.Tea tree can reach up to 15 m (49 ft) in height and can live anywhere between 30 and 50 years.The plant originates from China.Flowers and fruits Tea plantation Tea plantation Flower Flowers Leaves Flower bud Leaves Tea leaves Tea Content Uses Tea leaves are usually infused with boiling water to produce an infused drink.In China, most tea leaves are processed for green tea (little or no fermentation of the leaves) whereas most Assam tea is processed for black tea which is manufactured by fermenting and crushing the leaves.Propagation Basic requirements Tea grows best in warm and humid climates.
It will tolerate temperatures between 14 and 27Â°C (57.2â€“80.6Â°F) with 18â€“20Â°C (64.4â€“68Â°F) being optimum. Tea plants will not tolerate frost and mean temperatures should not fall below 13Â°C (55.4Â°F) or exceed 29Â°C (84.2Â°F).Tea grows optimally in deep, well-draining, tropical red soils with an acidic pH between 4.5 and 6.0.Tea requires an average annual rainfall of 1600 mm per year distributed evenly throughout the growing season.In growing regions that experience a long dry season, tea plants require shading to increase the humidity around the plants.Propagation Tea is propagated from seed or rooted leaf cuttings.Good quality seeds are selected by immersing in water for 30 minutes and selecting the seeds which sink.Seeds are commonly germinated by placing them between wet cloths.Seeds which successfully germinate are transferred to a nursery bed to grow for 2â€“3 years.Before transplanting to the field, the plants are cut back to a height of 15 cm (6.0 in).
Leaf cuttings are also used to establish new tea plantations. Single node cuttings are taken from the desired variety and rooted in polyethylene bags containing soil by firmly pressing the stem into the soil.The bags are then placed in a shaded area and watered regularly.New tea plants produced from rooted cuttings are usually planted out in the field after 6â€“9 months.Tea can be planted as single rows, double rows or as a hedge.Plantations established on slopes are planted on contour rows.Seedlings or cuttings are usually planted 60 cm (24 in) apart, allowing 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows.The tea plants are often interplanted with legumes or grasses to conserve soil moisture and prevent soil erosion.Shade trees are utilized in tea plantations grown at lower altitudes.General care and maintenance Newly planted tea plantations must be kept free from weeds while the tea plants establish.Weeding should be done by hand until the canopy closes and shades out weeds.
Tea plants should be pruned to encourage the production of lateral branches. Busjes are shaped by tipping and thinning of branches to create the desired shape.Pruning should be maintained throughout the life of the plantation to keep the plants a manageable size and maintain productivity.pruning is best carried out when the plants are dormant where possible.If trees do not have a dormant period then they should be pruned in winter or after the dry period depending on geographic location.The tree clippings can be left in the centers of the rows to acts as an organic mulch.Tea plantations are usually fertilized 2â€“3 times per year.The amount of each nutrient added to the soil will depend on the soilâ€™s own deficiencies and should ideally be based on the results of soil testing or by testing the leaves for nutrient deficiencies.Harvesting Tea is harvested by â€œpluckingâ€​ which involves the removal of the youngest leaves at the shoot terminals.
The terminal bud is removed along with the two leaves directly below (fine plucking) or the bud and three leaves (coarse plucking). The younger leaves have the best flavor and removing three leaves increases production but diminishes the overall quality by including an older leaf.Tea plants are plucked by hand by grasping the plant between thumb and forefinger and is usually carried out every 7â€“14 days depending on altitude.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Camellia sinensis (tea) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/10781.[Accessed 20 April 15].Paid subscription required .Crane, J.H.& Balerdi, C.F.(2013).Tea growing in the Florida home landscape.Available at: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/HS/HS30800.pdf.[Accessed 20 April 15].Free to access .Duke, J.A.(1983).Camellia sinensis (L.)

The plant is fine stemmed and grows in tufts.It produces a panicle (a branched flower cluster) with spikelets that hold the grain.The panicle can possess 190 to 1410 spikelets and can be either compact or loose in form.The teff grain ranges in colour from white to brown or reddish purple and is very small in size (1.0-1.7 mm in length).The plant produces 2-12 white or dark brown flowers on the spikelets.Teff is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season and it can grow 25-135 cm in height depending on the cultivar.Teff may also be referred to as Tef, Xaafii, lovegrass, annual bunch grass or warm season annual bunch grass and it originates from Ethiopia.Teff field in Ethiopia Teff Teff Uses Teff is grown predominantly as a cereal crop in Ethiopia.
The grain can be used to make flour or porridge or can be fermented and made into type of flatbread called injera , which is eaten widely in Ethiopia. Grain can also be used to brew alcoholic beverages or grown as a forage for livestock or for use in building construction.As the grain lacks gluten, it can be used to produce gluten-free specialty products for people with allergies to gluten.Teff Content Propagation Basic requirements Teff is a warm season annual and can can be grown in a wide range of climates and soil as it will tolerate both drought conditions and and waterlogging.If the soil is waterlogged it is generally preferred to grow the crop on a raised seed bed to help drainage.The crop can be grown at temperatures ranging from 10Â°C to 27Â°C in areas with an average annual rainfall of 450â€“550 mm, requiring 450â€“550 mm during the growing season.Teff plants are sensitive to daylength and optimal flowering is reached with a daylength of 12 hours.
Propagation Teff is grown directly from seed in a prepared seed bed. The field is prepared for planting by plowing several times and, in areas where drainage is poor, furrows or raised beds are created to aid drainage.In moisture-stressed fields, the seedbeds are tightly packed prior to sowing seed to help prevent the soil surface drying too quickly and minimize the effect of low moisture on germination Teff seeds are usually sown on the soil surface and left uncovered or are covered lightly with tree branches.Seeding rates vary by region but generally, 15â€“55 kg of seeds are sown per hectare of land.If seeds are sown mechanically with a broadcaster or seed drill, lower seeding rates can be used.Higher seeding rates are required when hand sowing teff seed due to the small size of the seeds making it difficult to broadcast evenly.General care and maintenance Teff should be grown in a weed-free field for best results.
Preparing the bed by plowing prior to planting the seeds will help to destroy existing weeds. If weeds begin to grow during the growing season the field may be hand weeded 25â€“30 days after teff emergence, when the plants reach the early tillering stage.If weeds continue to be a problem then a second hand weeding can be carried out when teff reaches the stem elongation stage.Weeding after heading is not recommended.Teff can be fertilized to promote good production.Fertilizer can be safely applied at the same time as seed is sown without adversely affecting germination.Addition of nitrogen to the soil promotes vegetative growth of teff, while phosphorus applications will promote grain, production.potassium has been found to be of little importance for the growth of teff.Harvesting Teff is ready for harvest between 60 and 120 days after planting when the leaves of the plants turn from green to yellow in color.
Prompt harvest before the plants dry out completely helps to prevent the seedheads from shattering, reducing losses. At harvest, care must be taken to ensure that the grain does not get mixed with soil as the small grain size makes it impossible to separate back out.The seed is separated from the chaff by trampling or threshing.Teff harvest References Ruskin, F.R.(ed.)

The thyme plant has an erect or ascending growth habit and possesses many woody, branching stems.The leaves of the thyme plant are linear or elliptical and are arranged alternately on the stems.
The leaves are densely covered in minute hairs and have numerous red-brown oil glands on the surface which take the appearance of small dots. The leaves can be green or variegated.The plant produces whorls of tiny pink, lilac or pale purple flowers on a terminal spike and tiny brown fruits, each with one seed.Thyme can reach a height of up to 50 cm (20 in) and can be grown as an annual or a perennial.Thyme may also be referred to as common or garden thyme and originates from the Mediterranean.Thyme Thyme Thyme flowering Uses Thyme leaves and flowers can be used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking.Bees which collect nectar from thyme flowers produce a high quality honey.Essential oil can be extracted from the leaves and is commonly used in the manufacture of perfume or as flavoring in toothpastes.Thyme Content Propagation Basic requirements Thyme grows best in warm, sunny climates at temperatures between 4 and 28Â°C (39.2â€“82.4Â°F) but will grow best at 16Â°C (60.8Â°F).
Established plants can survive temperatures down to -16Â°C (3.2Â°F). Thyme is tolerant of drought conditions but water-logged soil is detrimental to itâ€™s survival and production.Thyme will grow best in well-draining, fertile sandy loam or sand.Thyme should be planted in alkaline soils and require full sunlight for optimum productivity.Propagation Thyme is propagated from seed and can be direct seeded or sown in a nursery to produce transplants.Thyme can also be propagates from cuttings, air layering or by division of the roots.When planting seeds, they should be covered should be covered with a thin layer of soil to prevent them from drying out while they germinate.Seedlings should be thinned to a final spacing of 10â€“15 cm (4â€“6 in) allowing 20â€“25 cm (8â€“10 in) between rows.Transplants can be planted in the field after hardening when they are 5â€“8 cm (2â€“3 in) tall.
Cuttings should be taken from healthy, vigorous plants by taking a clipping about 7.6 cm (3 in) in length from the end of a branch. The leaves should be removed from the lower half of the cutting before planting in light textured potting media to root.The cutting should be watered regularly and kept moist, but not wet while they root.The new plants will be ready for transplanting after approximately 8 weeks.after hardening and are planted in the same way as seed-grown transplants.General care and maintenance It is common practice to mulch thyme plants with a layer of limestone gravel to suppress weeds, conserve soil moisture, improve drainage around the plant crown and reflect light back to the foliage.Once planted, thyme will grow adequately without fertilization, but will benefit from the occasional application of well aged manure or a balanced fertilizer.Similarly, thyme can withstand drought but will benefit from supplemental irrigation during dry periods.
The soil should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Thyme plants should be pruned regularly by pinching off the tips of the shoots to promote branching.Harvesting Thyme is best harvested just prior to flowering when the essential oil content of the leaves is at its highest.Plants can also be harvested during flowering but the flowers are very attractive to bees and this may make harvesting more problematic at this time.Thyme is harvested by cutting the branches 8â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in) above the ground.Cutting can be done by hand or, in the case of commercial production, by machine.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Thymus vulgaris (thyme) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/53795.[Accessed 21 April 15].Paid subscription required .Copsey, K.& Lerner, B.R.(2002).Growing herbs.Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/HO-28.pdf.[Accessed 09 April 15].Free to access .Herb Society of America (2003).

The tobacco plant has a thick, hairy stem and large, simple leaves which are oval in shape. The tobacco plant produces white, cream, pink or red flowers which grow in large clusters, are tubular in appearance and can reach 3.5-5.5 cm (1,25-2 in) in length.Tobacco may reach 1.2-1.8 m (4-6 ft) in height and as is usually grown as an annual, surviving only one growing season.Tobacco may also be referred to as Virginia tobacco or cultivated tobacco and originates from South America.Tobacco harvest Tobacco flowering Tobacco flowers Tobacco plants Tobacco field Tobacco plants Uses Tobacco is a stimulant and the dried leaves of the tobacco plant can be cured and used to produces tobacco cigarettes, cigars and snuff or for pesticide production.Tobacco Content Propagation Basic requirements Tobacco grows very well in a wide range of climates and will grow optimally at temperatures between 20 and 30Â°C (68â€“86Â°F) in areas where there is a dry period to facilitate harvest of the leaves.
The type of soil depends on the variety of tobacco being grown but the best yields are usually obtained in loam to sandy loam soils. The soil should have a pH between 5.0 and 6-6.Tobacco plants are easily damaged by waterlogged soils and quality can be affected by high salinity.Plants should therefore be grown in a well draining and well aerated soil.Propagation Tobacco is propagated from seed on protected (covered) seed beds or in the glasshouse and transplanted to the final growing site.Seeds grown outdoors are protected for the first few weeks to prevent weather damage to the emerging young plants.seedlings are transplanted after 30â€“60 days when they are approximately 15 cm (6 in) in height.The young plants should be spaced 46â€“61 cm (18-24 in) apart.General care and maintenance The best quality tobacco leaves are produced when the the flowerheads of the plants are removed, a process known as topping.
Topping plants promotes the development of suckers which should also be removed. Suckers are removed through the use of chemicals in commercial tobacco production with some hand removal also necessary.Fertilizer and irrigation requirements of tobacco vary with the variety being grown but generally, tobacco has a requirement of 40-80 kg per hectare of nitrogen, 80-90 kg per hectare of phosphorous and 50-110 kg per hectare of potassium.Harvesting Tobacco is harvested by hand in most parts of the world by picking 2â€“3 leaves from each plant per harvest.In the USA and Canada, tobacco plants are mechanically harvested by cutting the stalks of the plants.Only fully mature leaves should be harvested when hand picking is practices and harvests should be carried out at weekly intervals.After harvest, leaves are usually tied in pairs to cure.References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco)datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/36326.

Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors warm, wet weather; excessive fertilization can cause greater crop losses. Management Rotating crop away from tobacco can help to reduce the levels of inoculum in a field; stalks and roots left after harvest should be removed and destroyed; control nematodes in the soil; ensure plants have adequate potassium available to promote vigorous growth.Blue mold Peronospora tabacina Blue-gray fungal growth is produced on the underside of the spots when the fungus is active Blue mold symptoms on tobacco Blue mold symptoms on tobacco Tobacco seedlings infected with blue mold Blue mold symptoms on tobacco seedling Symptoms Circular patch of seedlings developing yellow leaves; seedlings in center may have leaves that have curled into a cup shape; fluffy blue spores developing on underside of leaves; distorted leaves; yellow lesions on leaves which may have blue mold growing on them.Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool, wet conditions.
Management Avoid over fertilizing tobacco crop and the use of overhead irrigation which created favorable conditions for the development of the fungus; applications of appropriate protective fungicides is usually necessary to control the disease in temperate and subtropical areas. Frogeye leaf spot Cercospora nicotianae Disease symptom on infected leaves Leaf spot symptoms Frogeye leaf spot on tobacco Symptoms The pathogen infects all stages of crop (even after the leaves are harvested).Initially the lower leaves exhibit brown, round lesions which resembles frog-eye shape (generally of 2 -15 mm in diameter) with grayish center.The disease spreads upwards.Under favorable condition lesions may coalesce to become bigger lesions resulting in drying of leaves.Also we can see black dots (spores) in the centre of this lesions.Cause Fungus Comments The disease is favored by wet weather conditions.The pathogen is more prevalent in Taiwan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Central America and India.
Management Remove and burn the infected leaves. Follow crop rotation.Keep the field free from weeds.Follow proper crop density.If the disease is severe apply suitable fungicides.Category : Oomycete Black shank Phytophthora parasitica Black shank symptom The split open stalk showing dark pith in discrete discs Black shank infected plant Stalks generally develop black lesions which may extend several inches above the ground Leaves with symptoms of the disease "Black shank" in this case called "Foliar Black shank" on dark tobacco.Symptoms Rapid yellowing and wilting of the plant proceeds plant death; dark brown to black sunken lesion is usually present on the stalk of the plant close to the soil line; lesion may extent up the stalk turning it black; splitting open stalks reveals darkened pith in discrete discs.Cause Oomycete Comments Disease emergence favors poorly drained soil and warm weather.
Management Rotating the crop away from tobacco for at least one year will help to reduce levels of inoculum; plant tobacco varieties that have some degree of resistance to the disease; apply appropriate fungicides to the soil; plant tobacco in well draining soils; destroy stalks and roots immediately after harvest to reduce overwintering sites for the pathogen; control nematodes in the soil.

Eventually the whole plant may wilt. Cause Weed Comments It will cause 30 to 70% yield loss depends on severity of infestation.Broomrape also attacks on tomato, okra, eggplant etc.Management Deep summer ploughing helps in exposing weed seeds to sunlight and reduce weed population.Remove the emerged weeds before flowering and burn them (hand weeding).Rotating the crop with sorghum, black gram etc., to reduce weed population.Category : Fungal, Oomycete Collar rot Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Plants can be rotted in half by complete rotting of a portion of the lower stem.Collar rot infected plants Lower stem of an infected plants which severely rotted.Symptoms Water-soaked, soft, green, lesion at base of stem; white mycelium present on lesion; black fungal structures developing out of the white fungal growth.Cause Fungus Comments Serious disease of glasshouse grown tobacco plants.
Management Reduce build-up of moisture in glasshouses by increasing ventilation and air circulation; increase frequency of leaf clipping and reduce the amount of leaves removed at each clipping; avoid injury to seedlings. Category : Bacterial Granville wilt Ralstonia solanacearum Infected stem Bacterial wilt infected plant Infected plant Symptoms on infected stem Symptoms Wilting on one side of the plant; entire plant begins to wilt and plant usually dies; if plant does not die then growth is usually stunted with twisted and distorted leaves; the stalk of the plant turns black, especially at the soil line.Cause Bacterium Comments The disease is most damaging in fields where tobacco has been grown the previous year and in wet areas of fields; bacterium can also colonize other Solanaceous crops such as tomato, pepper and eggplant as well as several weed species.
Management One of the most important management strategies for Granville wilt is crop rotation as the bacteria that cause the disease do not survive well in the absence of the tobacco host plant; a rotation away from tobacco for as little as one year is highly beneficial; some tobacco varieties are more susceptible to the disease than others, although none are completely immune, and should be grown when the disease is of concern; all tobacco crop debris should be removed and destroyed following harvest to reduce inoculum levels. Category : Viral Tobacco Leaf Curl disease Tobacco Leaf Curl Virus (TLCV) Begomovirus TLCV infected field Tobacco Leaf Curl Virus (TLCV) infected plant Symptoms The infected plants are stunted with twisted stem ; leaves become small, curled, twisted and puckered.The veins of infected leaves may become thickening or show enations.Cause Virus Comments The virus is transmitted by whiteflies Bemisia tabaci .Management Use available resistant varieties.
Controlling the whiteflies will reduce the virus spread- use yellow sticky traps or cover the tobacco seedling /nursery with nylon nets or growing barrier crops (like sunflower etc.,) around the nursery may reduce the white fly population. Tobacco mosaic Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) Infected leaf Tobacco plant showing symptoms of infection with Tobacco Mosaic Virus.Tobacco plant infected with TMV Symptoms Alternating light and dark green patches on the leaves; leaves turning brown and drying out.Cause Virus Comments Can be spread by farming equipment and on hand that have come into contact with cigarettes or other tobacco product; wash hands after tobacco use before touching plants.Management Plant resistant tobacco cariteies; remove and destroy any infected plants; disinfect tools thoroughly; wash hands thoroughly after use of tobacco products before handling plants; avoid having tobacco products on person when working with tobacco plants.

Pests Category : Insects Aphids Myzus persicae Development of sooty mold on tobacco leaves due to aphids infestation Aphid infestation Aphid infestation on tobacco leaf Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants. Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Horworms (Tobacco hornworm, Tomato hornworm) Manduca quinquemaculata Manduca sexta Hornworm larvae feeding on tobacco leaves Tobacco hornworm Tobacco leaf damaged by hornworms Symptoms Feeding damage to leaves or leaves stripped from plant; heavy infestation may result in damage to fruit appearing as large open scars; large green caterpillars may be spotted on plant; caterpillars may reach in excess of 7.5 cm (3 in) in length and possess a spike at the end of their body; most common species have 7 diagonal stripes on sides or 8 v-shaped markings on each side; single eggs may be present on leaves and measure approx 1.3 mm in diameter; eggs are in About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library initially light green in color and turn white prior to hatching. Cause Insect Comments Insect overwinters as pupa in soil; typically undergoes 2 generations per year; heavy infestations are more common in warm areas.
Management Hand pick larvae from plants leaving any parasitized larvae behind to promote populations of natural enemies (these larvae can be distinguished by the presence of white, oblong-shaped cocoons on their backs); sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis are organically acceptable and highly effective. Loopers (Cabbage looper, Alfalfa looper) Trichoplusia ni Autographa californica Cabbage looper and damage on tobacco Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color.Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range.
Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully.

Tomato is an herbaceous annual in the family Solanaceae grown for its edible fruit. The plant can be erect with short stems or vine-like with long, spreading stems.The stems are covered in coarse hairs and the leaves are arranged spirally.The tomato plant produces yellow flowers, which can develop into a cyme of 3â€“12, and usually, a round fruit (berry) that is fleshy, smoothed skin, and can be red, pink, purple, Tomato Content brown, orange, or yellow in color.The tomato plant can grow 0.7â€“2 m (2.3â€“6.6 ft) in height and as an annual, is harvested after only one growing season.Tomato may also be referred to as the love apple and originates from South America.Tomatoes are native to South and Central America, but they are now grown all over the world.Tomatoes are one of Africa's most widely grown vegetable crops.They are grown for home consumption in almost every homestead's backyard across Sub-Saharan Africa.
They are a good source of vitamins as well as a cash crop for smallholders and medium-scale commercial farmers. Tomatoes used as flavor enhancers in food are always in high demand, both fresh and processed.Tomatoes ripening on the vine Ripening fruits Flowers Immature tomato Tomato leaf close-up Tomato stems and foliage Tomato flower Unripe tomato fruits Ripe tomato fruit Varieties Tomatoes are classified into two types based on plant habit: determinate and indeterminate.Determinate (and semi- determinate) varieties have flower clusters at the end of their stems.The determinate is shorter and bushier, whereas the semi- determinate is taller.Indeterminate varieties produce new leaves and flowers all the time and can grow very tall.Indeterminate varieties bear fruit for a longer period of time.Indeterminate varieties must be staked and pruned and require more labor.
a).Roma tomato variety They are also referred to as a paste tomato Paste tomatoes, like roma tomatoes, have a thicker fruit wall, fewer seeds, and a denser but grainier flesh. Roma tomatoes are oblong in shape and large for their size.They are also firmer than non-roma or paste tomatoes.They are determinate in the sense that they ripen all of sudden in place of at some stage in the season.While they can be consumed raw, they are at their best when cooked.b).Anna F1 tomato variety These varieties produce very high yields, require less labor, and are relatively resistant to tomato diseases.It's a fresh market tomato variety that grows best in a greenhouse.It's an oval-shaped, deep-red fruits.It is one of Kenya's tomato varieties resistant to Alternaria stem canker, nematodes, and Fusarium wilt.This variety matures quickly, relatively seventy-five days after transplanting.Its maturity period is determined by the weather.
The first harvest of Anna F1 yields less than later harvests, as with most tomato varieties in Kenya. Anna F1 produces an average of 74 tons of tomatoes per acre and 35 kg per tomato plant.c).Bingo Bingo is a large-fruited Heirloom Tomato Seed is widely adapted to a wide range of growing conditions and consistently produces large, smooth fruit.To protect the fruit from sunburn, the plant grows a dense canopy of leaves.d).Plum A plum tomato, also known as a processing tomato or paste tomato, is a tomato variety bred for sauce and packing.They are typically oval or cylindrical in shape, with fewer locules than standard round tomatoes and a higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing.e).Cherry tomato The cherry tomato is a small round tomato that comes in red, yellow, green, and black colors.Since they're naturally sweet, they are typically eaten raw in salads.Uses Tomato fruit can be eaten raw or cooked and is used in many dishes.
The fruit may also be processed into juice, soup, ketchup, puree, paste or powder. Planting and propagation Tomatoes can be direct-seeded or transplanted in the field, but this method is costly because large amounts of seed are required (about 500 to 1000 g of seeds/ha) and four weeks of weeding labor is added to the growing costs.Growing young transplants in a special nursery, on the other hand, allows growers to achieve high seedling uniformity while using less seed and saving money on weeding.Nursery bed preparation: Build raised seedbeds with a maximum width of one meter in an area where no potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, or peppers have been grown in the last three years.Add about 5 kg of good compost per m2 to seedbeds that are finely cultivated on top.Use a pointed stick to drill shallow seeding furrows.One hectare of tomatoes necessitates 150 to 200 g of germinating seed.Sow seeds in the furrows and lightly cover with soil.
Firmly pat with the flat side of a rake or similar tool, then mulch and water generously. Fresh manure should never be used on a seed bed because it will burn young seedlings.After seedlings emerge, remove the mulch from the rows to allow sunlight to reach the young seedlings.Growing individual plants in banana leaf pots or plastic seedling trays improves eventual plant establishment by reducing transplant shock and root damage during transplanting.To maintain good, healthy growth, the young seedlings require adequate water.Reduce watering a week before transplanting to harden the seedlings.Seedlings that are three to four weeks old (15 to 25 cm tall with 3 to 5 true leaves) are ready for transplanting.To avoid root damage, seedlings must be thoroughly watered 12 to 14 hours before being lifted from the seedbed.To reduce transplant shock, plant seedlings in the afternoon or on a still, cloudy day, and water them immediately.
Plant establishment can be greatly accelerated by applying as little as a cup of water per plant immediately after planting. Plant spacing and distance between rows are determined by the cultivar's growth habit and whether the plants are to be staked or allowed to grow on the ground.Indeterminate varieties are typically staked, whereas determinate varieties can be grown without staking in the field.Plants are typically spaced 30 to 60 cm apart in single or double rows on 1.0 to 1.4 m wide beds.Husbandry Tomatoes respond well to liberal applications of well-rotted compost or manure.A spoonful (or three teaspoons) of rock phosphate should also be added to each planting hole.If the soil is deficient in organic matter, it is best to grow a crop of high- quality green manure like cowpeas, mucuna, soybeans, or crotalaria before transplanting tomato seedlings.
Avoid commercial nitrogen fertilizers because too much nitrogen causes fruit puffiness and blossom-end rot, as well as excessive vegetative growth. Excess free nitrogen in the soil softens the leaves and makes the plants more appealing to pests and diseases.Weed competition can be fierce, especially in the hot and humid tropics.Slash emerging weeds as close to the ground as possible between rows of tomatoes to control weeds on open land crops.Leave slashed weeds as mulch on the soil to help prevent erosion, lower soil temperature, and conserve soil moisture.This should be supplemented by manual weeding in rows and straw mulching of the beds.Staking For tall growing indeterminate varieties, firmly plant a 2 m stake in the ground for each tomato plant and loosely tie the stems as the plant grows.Alternatively, place a sturdy pole in the ground every four meters and run two wires - one at 2 meters and another at 0.15 meters above the ground.
Connect the two wires behind each tomato plant with a fairly strong string. As the plants grow, they can be carefully twisted around the strings.Pruning For indeterminate tomato varieties, pruning is required.On a weekly basis, one or two main stems should be allowed to grow and the side branches (laterals) should be pinched off as the crop grows.When 6 to 8 flower clusters form, the growing top should be pinched off to promote the development of large marketable fruit.Remove any leaves that are close to the ground to help prevent blight infection.On determinate cultivars, there is no pruning and no regulation of fruit number and clusters.Semi-determinate cultivars can be grown as both a determinate and an indeterminate crop.To avoid spreading tobacco mosaic virus disease, smokers should thoroughly wash their hands with soap before handling tomato plants.Tomatoes require adequate irrigation during the early stages of plant growth, fruit set, and fruit enlargement.
The consistency of water supply to the plants is critical in achieving uniform maturity. It also reduces the occurrence of blossom- end rot, a physiological disorder caused by a lack of calcium during fruit enlargement.Watering is required at least twice a week in dry weather.Because it does not cause water splashes on the plants, drip irrigation is the most efficient and risk-free method of irrigation.Although indeterminate, cherry tomatoes can produce quite well even when not staked in the field, but they must be given adequate space because they spread quite widely (one m2 per plant is recommended).Higher output and easier field management are advantages of the costly staking procedure.Harvesting and post handling practices.Before being marketed, fresh-market tomatoes are frequently harvested at the mature-green stage and ripened in transit or storage.
Ethylene is sometimes used to quickly and uniformly ripen mature-green tomatoes before shipping them to market, but this has a negative impact on quality. In Kenya, this is not a common practice.Pre-ripe tomatoes are generally of lower quality (lower soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and reducing sugars) than plant-ripened tomatoes.Fresh-market tomato cultivars' growth and ripening patterns necessitate frequent pickings for either mature-green or plant-ripe fruits.Processing tomatoes, as opposed to fresh market or table tomatoes, are picked fully ripe.Harvesting is often done by machine in developed countries.Tomatoes used in pureed products such as soup, juice, and sauces are grown until more than 85% of the fruits are ripe.Those for whole tomatoes are picked while still firm, but only about 65% of the crop may be ready at once.To prepare tomatoes for market, store them in a shady location, either in the field or at home, after picking.
The marketable fruits are then packaged in appropriate containers, which are typically 20-kg wooden boxes, bamboo baskets, plastic boxes, or other locally available packaging materials. Proper packaging protects the fruits and reduces water loss.Tomato storage life is determined by the maturity stage at which they are harvested as well as the desired fruit quality.Quality is highest when fully ripe, whether artificially or naturally.To ripen properly, mature-green tomatoes should be stored for 7 to 10 days at 13 to 18Â°C and 85 to 90% RH.The single most important visual parameter of tomato quality is color.Lycopene development is generally poor at temperatures above 30Â°C.This is the primary reason that tomatoes grown in the hot tropics have a pale red or yellowish color and are bland in flavor.Cherry tomato harvesting and packaging are determined by market demand.Fruit clusters can be cut for distant markets when the fruits turn red or pink, depending on the cultivar.
For the domestic market, firm red ripe fruits are required. However, cherry tomatoes for the export market are graded and packaged into pre-packs before being shipped directly to supermarkets in the export destinations.A marketable yield of 20 tons/ha or higher is considered a good yield.Under experimental conditions at KALRO, Thika Horticultural Research Station, yields of up to 60 tons/ha have been obtained.Climate conditions, soil and water management For high yield and premium quality, tomatoes prefer a relatively cool, dry climate.It is, however, adaptable to a wide range of climatic conditions.Tomatoes have been grown as far north (under protection) as the Arctic Circle and as far south as the hot and humid equator.Temperatures between 21 and 24Â°C are ideal for growth and development.Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 12Â°C can result in chilling.Temperatures above 27Â°C have a negative impact on growth and fruit set.
Pollen and egg cells are destroyed when the maximum daytime temperature is 38Â°C or higher for 5 to 10 days. Fruit set is also generally poor when nightÂ temperatures exceed 21Â°C just before and after flower formation.Flower abortion can also be caused by hot, dry winds.Tomatoes are not affected by day length and can produce fruit in photoperiods ranging from 7 to 19 hours.Tomatoes can be grown in a variety of soil types, from sandy loam to clay-loam soils rich in organic matter.The ideal pH range for soil is 6 to 6.5; higher or lower pH can result in mineral deficiencies or toxicities.Flooding for extended periods is harmful to tomato growth and development.Small-holder farmer tomato seed production It is not recommended to use hybrid varieties for seed production.The label "F1" denotes these varieties.If a hybrid variety is preferred, it can only be used for one generation (one crop cycle).
Conditions to be followed when producing seed: â€¢ The tomato seed should only be multiplied once. â€¢ The tomato seed plot should be 25 meters away from any other tomato crop.â€¢ The plot should not have recently had tomatoes planted.â€¢ The tomato crop should be scouted for pests and diseases on a regular basis.â€¢ Fruits should not be included in the first step for seed extraction.â€¢ After planting the seed, the off types should be uprooted as soon as possible.â€¢ The plot should be properly weeded.â€¢ Proper crop management is required, such as fertilizer application, pruning, staking irrigation, and so on.Seed extraction process â€¢ Pick ripe fruit from only robust, disease-free plants (plants free of bacterial canker, bacterial speck, bacterial spot, anthracnose fruit rot, early blight, late blight, and tomato mosaic virus).â€¢ Wash the fruit, preferably with a potassium-based soap, to reduce the risk of disease infection.
â€¢ Cut the fruit in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Alternatively, squeeze the pieces into a clean bucket, plastic, glass, or ceramic bowl until only the seed-jelly and fruit sap remain.â€¢ Cover the bowl with a cloth or paper to keep dirt and other contaminants out, but don't make it airtight.Allow the seeds to sit for 1 to 5 days (usually 2 to 3 days in warm areas).If seeds cannot be sown right away, they should be stored in a waterproof container (transparent plastic bag / clear glass bottle).Transparent materials allow sunlight in, reducing mould growth.Put some ashes in the bottom of the container to absorb moisture and keep the seeds from moulding.When storing seeds in pots or bottles, the tops should be covered with plastic film to prevent water seepage and mite infestation.â€¢ Keep the seed container in a cool, dry location.â€¢ Check the seeds for mould development on a regular (at least weekly) basis.If mould is found, the seeds should be dried again.
Seeds can be stored for up to two years if properly dried. One kg of tomatoes will produce between 1 and 4 grams of seeds.Square tomato cage Tomatoes with trellis Tomatoes growing with a stake support system Tomato trellis Creative tomato trellis Young tomato plant positioned within a cage Staked tomatoes growing in a raised bed Tomato cages give the plant support and keep fruit off of the ground References AVRDC Publication 04-609 (2004).Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV).AVRDC.Available at: http://203.64.245.61/web_crops/tomato/ToMV.pdf.[Accessed 22 April 15].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2013).Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/31837.[Accessed 09 February 14].Paid subscription required .Jones, J.P., Stall, R.E.& Zitter, T.A.(1991).Compendium of Tomato Diseases.American Phytopathological Society Press.Available for purchase from APS Press .Kopsell, D.(2000).Growing tomatoes.

Early blight symptoms on tomato foliage Early blight symptoms on tomato foliage Early blight symptoms on tomato foliage Symptoms Early blight symptoms start as oval shaped lesions with a yellow chlorotic region across the lesion; concentric leaf lesions may be seen on infected leaves; leaf tissue between veins is destroyed; severe infections can cause leaves to completely collapse; as the disease progresses leaves become severely blighted leading to reduced yield; tomato stems may become infected with the fungus leading to Alternaria stem canker; initial symptoms of of stem canker are the development of dark brown regions on the stem; stem cankers may enlarge to girdle the whole stem resulting in the death of the whole plant; brown streaks can be found in the vascular tissue above and below the canker region; fruit symptoms include small black v-shaped lesions at the shoulders of the fruit (the disease is also known black shoulder); lesions may also appear on the fruit as dark flecks with concentric ring pattern; fruit lesions can seen in the field or may develop during fruit transit to the market; the lesions may have a velvety appearance caused by sporulation of the fungus Cause Fungus Comments Disease can spread rapidly after plants have set fruit; movement of air-borne spores and contact with infested soil are causes for the spread of the disease Management Apply appropriate fungicide at first sign of disease; destroy any volunteer solanaceous plants (tomato, potato, nightshade etc); practice crop rotation Fusarium wilt Fusarium oxysporum Seedling showing browning of the vascular system Whole plant dying Wilting tomato plants Wilting tomato plants with characteristic yellow discoloration at top of plant Symptoms of fusarium wilt on tomato foliage Yellowing of the leaves on one side of the plant Fusarium wilt symptoms may appear on one half of an infected plant indicating the blockage in the vascular system on that side Fusarium wilt in tomato field Collapse of tomato plant infected with Fusarium wilt Discolored tomato stem tissue caused by fusarium wilt Yellowing, wilting, and necrosis of older leaves on one side of the plant Plants infected with Fusarium wilt Vascular discoloration caused by Fusarium wilt infection Symptoms of fusarium wilt on tomato foliage Symptoms Symptoms of Fusarium wilt may first appear as yellowing and wilting of leaves on one side of the leaf midrib or plant; one-sided symptoms are caused by a blockage in the vascular system supplying the symptomatic side of the plant; as the disease progresses, older leaves become necrotic and the plant begins to wilt; fruit on infected plants is smaller and yield is reduced; damage to leaves makes fruit susceptible to sunscald; stem symptoms may be mistaken for bacterial wilt but a bacterial ooze test will be negative; stem tissue becomes discolored brown Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors warm, moist soil Fusarium wilt is not a major issue in tomato production, however, the disease can still cause minor losses Management Plant resistant varieties; sanitize all equipment regularly; control root knot nematodes; rotate crops away from tomato for several years Gray mold (Botrytis blight) Botrytis cinerea Infected fruit Infected foliage Infected stem Gray mold symptoms on tomato fruit Sporulation on infected stem Symptoms on stem Gray mold symptoms on tomato stem Infected stem Gray molds infected stem Gray mold symptoms on tomato stem Symptoms Disease appears on tomato seedlings at or just below the soil line as a fuzzy gray-brown lesion which often girdles the stem, if stem is girdled all parts of the plant above the lesion begin to wilt; infected flowers and calyxes become covered in gray spores; unripe fruit turns light brown or gray in color and rots; green fruit infected by airborne spores develop circular white rings called â€œghost spotsâ€​.
Cause Fungus Comments Gray mold is usually associated with wounds on plants; can develop in relatively cool conditions. Management Liming soil to increase calcium content can help to reduce plant susceptibility to gray mold; application of appropriate fungicide prior to formation of dense canopy.Leaf Mold Passalora fulva Leaf mold symptoms Yellow spots due leaf mold Yellow areas on upper leaf surface Close-up of moldy growth on underside of leaf spot.Brown leaf spots on upper leaf surface Yellow spots Infected leaf, upper side Spots look diffuse on lower leaf surface.Leaf spots and sporulation on underside of leaf Symptoms on lower surface Brown, felt-like patches of conidia on lower leaf surface Spots look diffuse with fuzzy growth on lower leaf surface.
Spots on upper leaf surface due to leaf mold fungus Symptoms on leaf mold infected fruits Leaf mold symptoms on lower leaf surface Symptoms The older leaves exhibit pale greenish to yellow spots (without distinguishable margins) on upper surface. Whereas the lower portion of this spots exhibit green to brown velvety fungal growth.As the disease progress the spots may coalesce and appear brown.The infected leaves become wither and die but stay attached to the plant.The fungus also infects flowers and fruits.The affected flowers become black and drop off.The affected fruit intially shows smooth black irregular area on the stem end but later it becomes sunken, leathery and dry.Cause Fungus Comments The disease is favored by high relative humidity.Also a common disease in green house tomato crop.Management Grow available resistant varieties.Avoid leaf wetting and overhead application of water.Follow proper spacing to provide good air circulation around the plants.
Remove the infected plant debris and burn them. If the disease is severe scary suitable fungicide.Septoria leaf spot Septoria lycopersici Septoria leaf spot symptoms on tomato foliage Close-up of leaf lesion showing gray- white center with fungal fruiting bodies Septoria leaf spot lesion on tomato leaf Septoria leaf spot symptoms on tomato foliage Symptoms of Septoria leaf spot on tomato foliage Close-up of a Septoria lesion on tomato Septoria leaf spot symptoms on tomato leaf Symptoms Symptoms may occur at any stage of tomato development and begin as small, water-soaked spots or circular grayish- white spots on the underside of older leaves; spots have a grayish center and a dark margin and they may colasece; fungal fruiting bodies are visible as tiny black specks in the center of spot; spots may also appear on stems, fruit calyxes, and flowers.Cause Fungus Comments Spread by water splash; fungus overwinters in plant debris.
Management Ensure all tomato crop debris is removed and destroyed in Fall or plowed deep into soil; plant only disease-free material; avoid overhead irrigation; stake plants to increase air circulation through the foliage; apply appropriate fungicide if necessary. Target Spot Corynespora cassiicola Black lesions with conidia Symptoms The fungus infects all parts of plant.Infected leaves shows small, pinpoint, water soaked spots initially.As the disease progress the spots enlarge to become necrotic lesions with conspicuous concentric circles, dark margins and light brown centers.Whereas the fruits exhibit brown, slightly sunken flecks in the beginning but later the lesions become large pitted appearance.Cause Fungus Comments The pathogen infects cucumber, pawpaw , ornamental plants, some weed species etc.The damaged fruits are susceptible for this disease.Management Remove the plant debris and burn them.Avoid over application of nitrogen fertilizer.

Cause Fungi Comments Fungi survive in crop debris in soil; disease emergence favors cool weather.Management Plant resistant varieties; sanitize all equipment on a regular basis; rotate with non-susceptible crops.
Category : Bacterial Bacterial canker Clavibacter michiganensis A disease in rapid progress killing large sections of plants in a greenhouse Netted appearance of fruits on symptomatic plants Infected stem can be noticed when cut open Vascular discoloration of the stem of infected plants Raised spots on unripe fruit Raised spots on unripe fruit Bacterial canker and wilt of tomato Lesions on the fruit has a birdâ€™s eye appearance A cut portion of the stem indicating discoloration Leaf blighting spreading across a row in greenhouse production Progression of the symptoms on the entire plant in a greenhouse facility Foliar symptoms of bacterial canker and wilt Symptoms of bacterial canker and wilt on tomato stems Ripe fruits with netted appearance Severe leaf blighting under extremely high disease incidence Canker on the infected stem The first symptom is the unilateral wilting of plants and formation of light colored streaks up on leaf midribs, petioles and stems Foliar symptoms of bacterial canker and wilt Symptoms of bacterial canker and wilt on tomato fruit Symptoms Bacterial canker can affect tomato plants of any age, seedlings may be killed quickly once they become infected; initial symptoms of bacterial canker is the unilateral wilting of plants and formation of light colored streaks up and down the outside of the leaf midrib, petiole and stem; streaks on stems may break open to form cankers; mature leaves develop small necrotic spots on the upper leaf surfaces or small raised white spots on the leaves; white spots develop on fruit, usually while they are still green; spots on fruit develop a raised dark center and are known as "bird's eye spots" Cause Bacterium Comments Can cause serious crop losses Management Plant only certified seed and transplants; hot water treatment of seed to remove bacteria; rotate crops with non-host plants; turn crops into soil after harvest to promote decomposition Bacterial speck Pseudomonas syringae Spots on tomato fruit caused by bacterial speck Bacterial speck on tomato leaf Bacterial speck on tomato leaf Bacterial speck on tomato leaf Bacterial speck on tomato leaf Symptoms Dark specks appear on the leaves, often associated with a yellow halo; foliar symptoms of bacterial speck are very difficult to distinguish from bacterial spot but can be differentiated by symptoms on the fruit; lesions on fruit are much smaller than those caused by bacterial spot; lesions on fruit are raised and scaly.
Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors cool, moist weather. Management Do not plant in same area in successive years; use only high quality, disease-free seed and transplants; protective sprays of copper can help to reduce incidence of the disease.Bacterial spot Xanthomonas campestris pv.vesicatoria Xanthomonas euvesicatoria Xanthomonas perforans = [Xanthomonas axonopodis (syn.campestris) pv.
vesicatoria], Xanthomonas vesicatoria Xanthomonas gardneri Leaves will ooze from the cut end only in case of bacterial spot Lesions on the fruit can also be raised around the margins and sunken in the middle Lesions may coalesce forming necrotic areas on the leaf giving it a blighted appearance Severe infections causes the leaves to look blighted bacterial spot causes significant crop losses during rainy conditions Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato foliage Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato foliage Bacterial spot symptoms on tomato foliage Fruit spots can also be slightly raised and scabby looking Fruit infections start as a slightly raised blister Mature spots, with or without yellowing have a greasy appearance and can be transparent Bacterial spot lesions starts out as small water-soaked spots.
Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato fruit Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato fruit Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato foliage Lesions on the fruit can also be raised around the margins and sunken in the middle Severe defoliation of infected plants can occur leading to a blighted look in large tomato fields Petioles with spot lesions are turning yellow followed by complete necrosis Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato foliage Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato foliage Symptoms of bacterial spot on tomato fruit Bacterial spot symptoms on tomato fruit Symptoms Bacterial spot lesions starts out as small water-soaked spots; lesions become more numerous and coalesce to form necrotic areas on the leaves giving them a blighted appearance; of leaves drop from the plant severe defoliation can occur leaving the fruit susceptible to sunscald; mature spots have a greasy appearance and may appear transparent when held up to light; centers of lesions dry up and fall out of the leaf; blighted leaves often remain attached to the plant and give it a blighted appearance; fruit infections start as a slightly raised blister; lesions may have a faint halo which eventually disappears; lesions on fruit may have a raised margin and sunken center which gives the fruit a scabby appearance.
Cause Bacterium Comments Bacteria survive on crop debris; disease emergence favored by warm temperatures and wet weather; symptoms are very similar to other tomato diseases but only bacterial spot will cause a cut leaf to ooze bacterial exudate; the disease is spread by infected seed, wind-driven rain, diseased transplants, or infested soil; bacteria enter the plant through any natural openings on the leaves or any openings caused by injury to the leaves. Management Use only certified seed and healthy transplants; remove all crop debris from planting area; do not use sprinkler irrigation, instead water from base of plant; rotate crops.
Bacterial wilt Ralstonia solanacearum A field of tomato with high bacterial wilt incidence (80-90%) Secondary spread through water movement to adjacent plants on both sides from an infected plant Darkening of the vascular system Large section of severely infected plants Bacterial ooze from a freshly cut stem Severe symptoms of bacterial wilt Severely wilted tomato plants Surface of the stem is darkening and collapsing Tomato plants infected with bacterial wilt Symptoms Initial symptoms of the disease is the wilting of a few of the youngest leaves; the disease progresses rapidly in hot weather and the entire plant wilts suddenly and dies; in cooler conditions, wilting is less rapid and plant may produce roots on the stems; vascular tissue shows a brown discoloration and decaying roots; stems cut under water will ooze bacterial exudate and will confirm the symptoms are not caused by Fusarium wilt.
Cause Bacterium Comments Bacterial wilt can cause complete destruction of the crop under conditions suitable for the spread of the soil-borne bacterium; disease causes serious losses in tomatoes grown in tropical and subtropical regions. Management Cultural practices may help to reduce incidence of the disease, rotate tomato with other, non-susceptible crops; avoid over-watering plants.
Category : Other Blossom-end rot Internal symptoms of BER BER on the side of the fruit Light tan, water-soaked areas on tomato fruit Blossom-end rot on tomato fruit Blossom-end rot on tomato fruit Blossom-end rot on tomato fruit Blossom-end rot on tomato fruit Blossom-end rot on tomato fruit Blossom-end rot on tomato fruit The problem often occurs at the blossom end of the fruit Blossom-end rot on tomato fruit Symptoms Blossom end-rot is caused by a low concentration of calcium in the tomato fruit; symptoms initially appear as light tan, water-soaked areas which can then enlarge and turn black and leathery in appearance; symptoms are most often seen at the blossom end of the fruit, but may also occur on the side of the fruit; blossom-end rot may also occur internally with no visible symptoms on outside of fruit. Cause Physiological disorder.Comments Low calcium may result from competition from other ions in soil e.g.
potassium; can also be caused by drought stress; fluctuations in soil moisture or application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer which promotes rapid vegetative growth; calcium cannot be translocated from the leaves to the fruit; foliar applications of Ca materials have not proven to reduce BER, since very little Ca is taken up by the fruit; in greenhouse production not cycling the irrigation system at night can increase BER, since night is an important period of Ca uptake. Management Maintain soil pH at 6.5; lime soil to increase the concentration of calcium in soil and decrease competition with other ions; use mulch to reduce drought stress; avoid ammonium fertilizers as they may increase competition with calcium by increasing ammonium ions in soil, use nitrate instead; avoid over fertilizing.
Catface Catfacing Catface symptoms Catface symptoms Catface symptoms Catface symptoms Symptoms Catface usually occurs on the blossom end, tomato fruits are usually misshapen with large holes or corky brown scars close to the blossom end of the fruit; fruits are often flattened and may be kidney shaped; holes on the fruit extend deep inside the fruit. Cause Physiological disorder Comments The catface deformity is possibly caused by internal or external changes that occurs during the formation of the flower resulting in the abnormal development of the fruit; the exact cause is unknown, there may be several factors in fruit deformation; cold weather is known to be a factor along with extreme fluctuations in temperatures between day and night; hormone based herbicides may also cause catfacing; varieties that produce large tomatoes are more prone to catfacing.
Management Avoid pruning tomato plants excessively; avoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen which promotes rapid vegetative growth; if growing tomatoes in a glasshouse, provide the plants with heat to prevent temperatures dropping to damaging levels, particularly at night.
Edema (Oedema) Close-up of edema blister Symptoms of edema on tomato leaves Close-up of edema blister Edema symptoms Edema Symptoms of edema on tomato leaves Symptoms Swellings and/or blisters or calluses on leaves caused by rupturing epidermal and inner leaf cells ; deformed foliage which curls; leaf tissue may also tear as the leaf matures; symptoms are often mistaken for disease or insect damage Cause Physiological disorder Comments Edema occurs when water is absorbed from the soil faster than it can be transpired through the leaves and is caused by soil being warmer than the surrounding air Management Tomato plants should always be planted in well draining soil or potting media; avoid overwatering tomato plants, particularly during periods of low light and cool temperatures; if growing tomatoes in a glasshouse then anything that can be done to increase drainage and air circulation will be helpful in preventing edema; reduce humidity in the glasshouse in the morning by venting the house (heat may need to be turned up during this period depending on outdoor temperatures) Fertilizer burn Symptoms Symptoms may first appear as slowed growth and wilting; leaf tips and margins turn brown; plants have a scorched appearance.
Cause Excess nitrogen salts Comments Fertilizer burn is usually caused by an excess of nitrogen salts in the soil which causes an osmotic stress on the plant tissues. The tissues dry out and die resulting in the characteristic scorched appearance of the leaves.Management Apply appropriate dose of fertilizer for the particular soil in which the plants are growing - nutrient requirements can be ascertained with a soil test; if liquid fertilizer was used, symptoms may be reversed by watering the plants heavily to leach some of the salts from the soil.
Little leaf Little leaf symptoms Interveinal chlorosis and leaf distortion caused by Little leaf Little leaf symptoms Little leaf symptoms Little leaf symptoms Interveinal chlorosis Symptoms Little leaf symptoms include interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, distortion and failure of leaves along the midrib to expand, radial cracks of fruits extending from the calyx to the blossom scar and failure of blooms to set; symptoms progress to increased leaflet distortion and more pronounced interveinal chlorosis. Cause Physiological disorder Comments Three conditions appear to pre-dispose plants to little leaf.1) high soil temperatures 2) high soil moisture and 3) presence of predisposing population of bacterial/fungal microorganisms in the soil.Management Little leaf is usually associated with water-logged areas of fields, subsequent drying out of affected areas usually resolves the problem and subsequent plant growth is normal; controlling the soil pH may also help the problem.
Magnesium deficiency Magnesium deficiency Symptoms Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear on older leaves first; initial symptoms are interveinal chlorosis of the leaves and, occasionally, a purple tinge to the leaves; as the deficiency becomes more severe, leaves may appear white with green veins; severe deficiencies may lead to reduced fruit yield. Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Magnesium deficiency is rare in field grown tomatoes but occurs more frequently in soilless tomato culture.Management Magnesium deficiency can be prevented in tomato by applying dolomite lime to the soil, if an increase in soil pH is required, or through applications of a fertilizer containing magnesium.
Multiple nutrients deficiency Symptoms Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Nitrogen deficiency Symptoms Affected plants are smaller in size and grow less vigorously than healthy plants; symptoms appear on older leaves first; tomato leaves exhibit a general yellowing occasionally accompanied by purple leaf veins; plants possess thinner stems and fruit is smaller than healthy plants; fruits may be misshapen with a lighter red color than healthy plants. Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Nitrogen deficiency usually arises in tomato plantations through inadequate fertilizer application; heavy rain can leach nitrogen from sandy soils.Management If detected early, symptoms of nitrogen deficiency can be treated by applying appropriate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer.
Phosphorous deficiency Symptoms Growth of tomato seedlings is reduced compared with healthy plants; leaves appear darker green and may have a purple tinge; in older tomato plants, leaves grow upright and appear light green on the upper surface and purple on the lower surface; symptoms appear on older leaves first. Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Phosphorous deficiency is rare in soils that are already used for agricultural purposes; in field grown tomatoes phosphorous deficiency more commonly appears in newly cleared land which has never been used to grow crops; phosphorus deficiency may occur on soilless tomato cultures if applications of the nutrient are inadequate.Management Soil levels of phosphorous should be measured prior to planting to determine the appropriate application for the particular site; phosphorous should be applied to the soil prior to planting if required as applications made after the onset of tomato growth are not usually successful in preventing symptoms.
Potassium deficiency Symptoms Affected plants are smaller than healhty plants with smaller fruits and reduced yields; tomato leaves exhibit "bronzing", older plant leaves turn tan and then brown at the margins; if deficiency is prolonged, leaves become necrotic at the margins and turn yellow between leaf veins. Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Potassium deficiency is usually caused by an inadequate fertilization, it is more common in sandy soils where the nutrient is easily leached from the soil by heavy rainfall.Management Potassium deficiency can be corrected through applications of the nutrient as a side dressing and/or through an irrigation system.
Sunscald sunscald affected fruit Sunscald on tomato Sunscald Sunscald on tomato Symptoms Symptoms of sunscald are most common on green fruit; white or yellow necrotic patches develop on the sides of the fruit that are facing the sun; blisters may be white with a yellow halo; damaged areas may become flattened in appearance and papery in texture; damaged areas are often invaded by secondary pathogens and turn black. Cause Physiological disorder Comments Sunscald is common on plants which have been moved suddenly from a shaded location to full sun.Management Healthy plants with full foliage are less susceptible to sunscald as the leaves provide fruits with shading, ensure plants are watered regularly and fertilized adequately; use shade cloth to protect the fruits from the sun; control diseases that develop to prevent defoliation which can lead to sunscald.
Water stress Moisture stress rings (from fluxuations in water, most likely because of heavy rains) Water stress cracks on tomato fruits Symptoms Leaves are green but wilting; leaves roll downwards and eventually drop from the plant; fruits may develop symptoms of Blossom-end rot (See entry). Cause Physiological stress Comments It is important to distinguish between plants that are temporarily wilted on hot days and those that are stressed due to lack of moisture in the soil; on very hot days tomato plants will wilt as the rate of transpiration exceeds the rate at which water can be taken up from the soil by the roots and the plants will usually recover in the evening when temperatures are cooler.Management Tomato plants should be watered deeply and evenly to avoid water stress; aim to keep the soil moist but not wet; allow the top of the soil to dry before watering again.
Zippering Zippering Zippering of tomato Symptoms Thin brown scars extending longutudinally from the petiole to the blossom-end of the fruit; each scar has smaller scars crossing it tranversely rendering it zipper-like in appearance; holes may open on along the scarred area. Cause Physiological disorder Comments Zipper scars on tomato fruit are most prevalent in cool weather.Management The most effective method of preventing zippering is to grow tolerant varieties; when growing tomatoes in the glasshouse, appropriate temperatures should be maintained.Category : Oomycete Buckeye rot (Phytophthora root rot) Phytophthora spp.
Buck eye symptoms on green fruit Root rot infection on young plants Symptoms of buckeye rot on tomato fruit Buck eye symptoms on green fruit Tomato fruits infected with buckeye rot Symptoms of buckeye rot on tomato fruit Completely wilted plants due to Phytophthora root rot Tomato fruits infected with buckeye rot Symptoms of buckeye rot on tomato fruit Symptoms Buck eye rot of tomato initially appears as a brown spot on the fruit which enlarges over the fruit surface and forms concentric rings; the lesions may eventually cover up to half of the fruit and the flesh develops a soft rot underneath the skin; green or red fruits can be affected and disease often develops where fruit is in contact with the soil; white cottony growth may be visible in the centers of affected regions; spots enlarge and form large concentric ring shaped symptoms which are usually brown in color with sunken edges; the Phytophthora pathogen also causes root rot; young plants may exhibit a white cottony growth at crown of the plant and begin to wilt as the damage to the roots progresses; Phytophthora root rot can cause severe destruction of plant roots and cause the plants to wilt completely.
Cause Fungi Comments Prolonged period of warm wet conditions favor disease occurrence; heavy soil saturation also favors disease development in soils where pathogen is present; disease can be spread by splashing water. Management Cultural control methods such as mulching around the plants and practicing rotation away from tomato can help to reduce losses from the disease; fungicides applied for the control of late blight also help to control the development of buckeye rot; solarizing or fumigating soil can help to reduce levels of inoculum.
Late blight Phytophthora infestans The entire fruit can become infected, and the white mycelium may appear during wet weather Fruit lesions start as water soaked regions Late blight symptoms on tomato stem Late blight symptoms on tomato leaves Late blight stem lesion Late blight symptoms on tomato Late blight symptoms on tomato Tomato plantation with late blight infestation Late blight symptoms on tomato foliage Late blight symptoms on tomato foliage Fruit lesions changes to greasy spots White moldy growth on the underside of the leaves Late blight symptoms on tomato leaves Late blight symptoms on tomato stem Late blight symptoms on tomato stem Late blight symptoms on tomato Late blight symptoms on tomato fruit Late blight lesion on tomato leaf Late blight symptoms on tomato fruit Late blight symptoms on tomato fruit Foliage becomes shriveled and brown Leaf lesions appear as water- soaked regions that rapidly change to brown lesions Late blight symptoms on tomato Late blight symptoms on tomato stems Late blight symptoms on tomato foliage Late blight symptoms on tomato Late blight symptoms on tomato Tomato plants damaged by late blight Late blight symptoms on tomato fruit Late blight symptoms on tomato foliage Symptoms Late blight affects all aerial parts of the tomato plant; initial symptoms of the disease appear as water-soaked green to black areas on leaves which rapidly change to brown lesions; fluffy white fungal growth may appear on infected areas and leaf undersides during wet weather; as the disease progresses, foliage becomes becomes shriveled and brown and the entire plant may die; fruit lesions start as irregularly shaped water soaked regions and change to greasy spots; entire fruit may become infected and a white fuzzy growth may appear during wet weather.
Cause Oomycete Comments Can devastate tomato plantings. Management Plant resistant varieties; if signs of disease are present or if rainy conditions are likely or if using overhead irrigation appropriate fungicides should be applied.Category : Viral Tomato mosaic virus Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) Symptoms on leaves Tomato Mosaic Virus (Tobamovirus ToMV) infected tomato plant Tomato Mosaic Virus symptom on tomato plant ToMV infected tomato leaf Symptoms Symptoms can occur at any growth stage and any part of the plant can be affected; infected leaves generally exhibit a dark green mottling or mosaic; some strains of the virus can cause yellow mottling on the leaves; young leaves may be stunted or distorted; severely infected leaves may have raised green areas; fruit yields are reduced in infected plants; green fruit may have yellow blotches or necrotic spots; dark necrotic streaks may appear on the stems, petioles leaves and fruit.
Cause Virus Comments ToMV is a closely related strain of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), it enters fields via infected weeds, peppers or potato plants; the virus may also be transmitted to tomato fields by grasshoppers, small mammals and birds. Management Plant varieties that are resistant to the virus; heat treating seeds at 70Â°C (158Â°F) for 4 days or at 82â€“85Â°C (179.6â€“185Â°F) for 24 hours will help to eliminate any virus particles on the surface of the seeds; soaking seed for 15 min in 100 g/l of tri-sodium phosphate solution (TSP) can also eliminate virus particles - seeds should be rinsed thoroughly and laid out to dry after this treatment; if the virus is confirmed in the field, infected plants should be removed and destroyed to limit further spread; plant tomato on a 2-year rotation, avoiding susceptible crops such as peppers, eggplant, cucurbits and tobacco; disinfect all equipment when moving from infected areas of the field.
Tomato spotted wilt Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) Severe stunting of the plants can also be seen in case of TSWV infection Leaf purpling can vary in its form for different varieties Numerous small ring spots on a fruit infected with TSWV. Severe leaf spot symptoms can be seen Leaf spots may resemble bacterial spot Symptoms of TSWV on tomato foliage Symptoms of TSWV on tomato fruit TSWV symptoms on tomato fruit Fruit necrosis and splitting Zonate ring spots on a fruit infected with TSWV.Large ring spot symptoms Large necrotic areas may form on the leaves Symptoms of TSWV Symptoms of TSWV on tomato foliage Tomato plants infected with TSWV TSWV symptoms on tomato fruit Leaf purpling is another symptom of plants infected with TSWV.
Complex ring spots on fruit infected with TSWV Fruit symptoms on a mature green fruit Leaf symptoms Symptoms of TSWV vary among different varieties of tomato Necrotic spots on tomato leaf caused by TSWV TSWV symptoms on tomato leaf Symptoms Infected plants exhibit bronzing or purpling of the upper sides of young leaves and develop necrotic spots; leaf spots may resemble those caused by bacterial spot, but a bacterial ooze test will be negative; leaves may cup downwards, shoot tips may begin to die back; symptoms on ripe fruit appear as chlorotic spots and blotches, often with concentric rings; ring spot symptoms vary with different tomato cultivars; irregular ripening caused by TSWV can also show up when fruit are treated with ethylene gas; green fruit may exhibit slightly raised areas with faint concentric zonation.
Cause Virus Comments TSWV infects numerous ornamentals, vegetables, field crops and weeds; virus is vectored by at least eight species of thrips; thrips, acquires the virus during the larval stages,and transmit the virus when they are adults. Management Control populations of western flower thrips and onion thrips Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl disease Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) family Geminiviridae, genus Begomovirus Early infection of tomato by tomato yellow leaf curl virus often leads to severe stunting of the plant.Infected plant in the foreground with an uninfected one in the back.Symptoms on infected tomato plant Infection at later stages of the plant often leads to stunting and malformation of terminals, yellowing of leaf margins and the characteristics upward cupping of leaves ("leaf curl") Symptoms of TYLCV on greenhouse- grown tomatoes.
Tomato Leaf Curl Virus symptoms TYLCV infected plant Symptoms on leaves Yellowing and shortening of internodes of greenhouse-grown tomatoes due to TYLCV. Tomato plant affected by Tomato Leaf Curl Virus.TYLCV infected field TYLCV infected leaves Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (Begomovirus TYLCV) infected plant Symptoms The infected leaves become reduced in size, curl upward, appear crumpled and show yellowing of veins and leaf margins.The internodes become shorter and whole plant appear stunted and bushy.The whole plant stand erect with only upright growth.The flowers may not develop and drop off.Cause Virus Comments The virus is transmitted by white flies and may cause 100 % yield loss if the plants infect at early stage of crop.The virus also infect other hosts like common bean, ornamental plants and several weed species.Management Grow available resistant varieties.Transplant only disease and whiteflies free seedlings.Remove the infected plants and burn them.
Keep the field free from weeds. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and control whiteflies.If the insect infestation is severe spray suitable insecticides.
Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Peach aphid, Potato aphid) Myzus persicae Macrosiphon euphorbiae Potato aphids feeding on tomato leaf Green peach aphid adult Green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) nymphs Potato aphid on tomato leaf Potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) on tomato leaves Aphids feeding on tomato (note presence of 'mummies' - parasitized aphids) Potato aphids adult Green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) adults Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or be distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants.
Cause Insect Comments Distinguishing features of aphids include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the insect's body; aphids will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; aphids may also transmit plant viruses to the plant when they feed.
Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Beet armyworm eggs covered in white hairs Young larvae Beet armyworm larva Symptoms Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside. Cause Insect Comments Insect can go through 3-5 generations a year.
Management Organic methods of controlling the beet armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis ; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae. Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Adult beetles on Jimsonweed Larva Colorado potato beetle larvae on tomato leaf Adult beetle Symptoms Feeding damage to foliage; if infestation is severe or if left untreated plants can be completely defoliated; adult insect is a black and yellow striped beetle; larvae are bright red with black heads when they first hatch and change color to pink; larvae have two rows of black spots.
Cause Insect Comments Adult beetles emerge in spring; female beetles lay eggs in batches of up to two dozen; eggs are orange-yellow and are laid on undersides of leaves; a female can lay 500 or more eggs over a four to five week period. Management Control of Colorado potato beetle can be challenging as they have developed high levels of insecticide resistance; adults and larvae should be hand picked from plants and destroyed in soapy water; applications of Bacillus thuringiensis can be effective at controlling larvae but should be applied frequently; some insecticides, including spinosad, are still effective against adult beetles.Cutworms Various species including: Agrotis spp.Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians etc.
Cutworm feeding on plant stem Cutworms will curl up into a characteristic C shape when disturbed Cutworms larva severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but are usually dirty gray or brown to black with dark spots or lines and will curl up into a characteristic C-shape when disturbed Cause Insect Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Flea beetles Epitrix spp.
Potato flea beetle injury on potato leaf Flea beetle damage to tomato leaves and fruit Typical shothole feeding wounds of potato flea beetles on tomato leaf Flea beetles causing damage to a young tomato seedling Feeding damage to tomato fruit Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; feeding damage may also occur on the fruit; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance. Cause Insects Comments Flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year.
Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied.
Hornworms (Tomato hornworm, Tobacco hornworm) Manduca quinquemaculata Manduca sexta Tomato hornworm frass Tobacco hornworm Tomato hornworm (Manduca quinquemaculata) on tomato Tomato hornworm (note black spike on posterior) Tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) on tomato vine Parasitized tobacco hornworm with wasp cocoons on its back Symptoms Feeding damage to leaves or leaves stripped from plant; heavy infestation may result in damage to fruit appearing as large open scars; large green caterpillars may be spotted on plant; caterpillars may reach in excess of 7.5 cm (3 in) in length and possess a spike at the end of their body; most common species have 7 diagonal stripes on sides or 8 v-shaped markings on each side; single eggs may be present on leaves and measure approx 1.3 mm in diameter; eggs are in initially light green in color and turn white prior to hatching.
Cause Insect Comments Insect overwinters as pupa in soil; typically undergoes 2 generations per year; heavy infestations are more common in warm areas. Management Hand pick larvae from plants leaving any parasitized larvae behind to promote populations of natural enemies (these larvae can be distinguished by the presence of white, oblong-shaped cocoons on their backs); sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis are organically acceptable and highly effective.Leafminers Tuta absoluta Lyriomyza spp.
Water synthetic sex pheromones trap for Tuta absoluta Tuta absoluta adult insect Leafminer damage on tomato plant Leafminer injury to tomato leaves Tomato leafminer damage Leafminer damage on tomato leaf Leaf miner injured tomato leaves Leafminer damaged leaves Symptoms Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; heavy mining can result in white blotches on leaves and leaves dropping from the plant prematurely; early infestation can cause fruit yield to be reduced; adult leafminer is a small black and yellow moth which lays its eggs in the leaf; larvae hatch and feed on leaf interior. THIS IS A TEST Cause Insect Comments Origin and distribution of Tuta absoluta : This species is originated in South American countries.Later the insect spread to Spain (2006), France, Italy, Greece, Malta, Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Turkey in following years.Further the insect has been identified in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman and the rest of the Gulf states.
In Africa it spreads from Egypt to Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (in East) and to Senegal and Nigeria through the west. (It spread through infested fruits and packaging materials) Life cycle: Mature larvae drop from leaves into soil to pupate; entire lifecycle can take as little as 2 weeks in warm weather; insect may go through 7 to 12 generations per year.Yield loss: If unchecked, insect will cause 100% yield loss.The larvae feeds on apical buds, tender new leaflets, flowers, and green fruits which make it a serious pest in tomato.Host Range: This insect also attacks other solanaceous crops like potato, eggplant, pepino and tobacco.It is also reported on many solanaceous weeds.
Management Leafminer natural enemies normally keep populations under control; check transplants for signs of leafminer damage prior to planting; remove plants from soil immediately after harvest if making new plantings in same place or close by; keep the field free from weeds especially Solanum, Datura, Nicotiana; use pheromone traps and white sticky traps to monitor and control insect;only use insecticides when leafminer damage has been identified as unnecessary spraying will also reduce populations of their natural enemies.
Loopers (Cabbage looper , Alfalfa looper) Trichoplusia ni Autographa californica Early install cabbage looper larvae Cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) larvae Cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) eggs on tomato leaves Cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) adult Cabbage looper and damage Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color. Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range.
Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may also damage populations of natural enemies and should only be considered if sunburn of fruit is likely. Stinkbugs (Various) Various Stink bug feeding on a fruit Red shouldered stink bug Brown stink bug feeding on tomato fruit White to yellow spots occurring under the epidermis are a characteristic symptom of cloudy spot caused by stink bug feeding.The symptom is developed due to the release of an enzyme that affects the coloring of a ripening fruit.
Newly hatched brown marmorated stink bug eggs and young larvae A ripe fruit with a yellow irregular spots Brown marmorated stink bug Symptoms Dark colored pinpricks on fruit surrounded by a lighter area that turns yellow or remains light green; stink bugs often carry pathogens in their mouthparts which can cause secondary infections and decay of fruit; adult insect is shield- shaped and brown or green in color; may have pink, red or yellow markings; eggs are drum shaped and laid in clusters on the leaves; larvae resemble the adults but are smaller. Cause Insect Comments Several types of stink bug can cause damage to tomatoes; adult insects overwinter under leaves, on legumes, blackberries or on certain weeds such as mustard or Russian thistle.
Management Remove weeds around crop which may act as overwintering sites for stink bugs and practice good weed management throughout the year; organically accepted control methods include the use of insecticidal soaps, kaolin clay and preservation of natural enemies; chemical treatments are not recommended for tomatoes that are to be processed for paste or canning unless secondary infections with other pathogens are a concern. Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Smaller, tan thrips on left is the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci).Larger yellowish thrips on the right is the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis).Green tomato showing damage caused by flower thrips (Frankliniella tritici).
Western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) damage Western flower thrips onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) damage on tomato Symptoms If population is high leaves and buds may be distorted; leaves appear silvery and are speckled with black feces; most damage occurs through the transmission of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV); insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color. Cause Insect Comments Transmit Tomato spotted wilt virus (see disease entry); once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life.Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic.
Tomato fruit worm (Corn earworm) Helicoverpa zea Corn earworm adult Corn earworm larva feeding on tomato fruit Larva damaging fruit Early instar larva on tomato leaf Late instar larva on tomato foliage Tomato fruitworm feeding on fruit Symptoms Holes in tomato fruit, including entry holes near stem end; feeding turns inside of tomato into a watery cavity filled with cast skins and frass (insect feces); damaged fruit ripens prematurely; young caterpillars are cream-white in color with a black head and black hairs; older larvae may be yellow-green to almost black in color with fine white lines along their body and black spots at the base of hairs; eggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are initially creamy white but develop a brown-red ring after 24 hours and darken prior to hatching.
Cause Insect Comments Adult insect is a pale green to tan, medium sized moth; can be one of the most damaging pests of tomato; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil; the insect is also a damaging pest of corn and is also referred to as the corn earworm. Management Early treatment of tomato fruitworms is necessary as once they enter the fruit they are protected from sprays; monitor plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations.
Category : Others Curly top Beet curly top virus (BCTV) BCTV symptoms on tomato Curly top symptoms on tomato Symptoms Young plants are usually killed by the virus; older plants are stunted and turn yellow to bronze in color with purple-tinged leaves; leave become thickened and roll upwards; leaf petioles roll downwards; green fruit turns red regardless of its age and becomes dull in color and wrinkled; plants do not recover form the disease and will not flower of produce fruit after infection. Cause Virus Comments Virus is transmitted by beet leafhoppers; insects transmit the disease between over 300 species of plant, including beets, tomato, squash, swiss chard, cucumber and melon.
Management There is no resistance to Beet curly top virus in tomato so control relies on the management of the leafhopper vector; dense stands of tomato may discourage leafhoppers from visiting the plants; chemical spraying programs to protect against beet leafhoppers have been implemented in some areas of the US state of California ; in areas where the virus is a chronic problem, n areas where curly top is chronic, dense plant spacing, shading, row covers, and intercropping have been reported to reduce levels of infection. Category : Nematodes Root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.The characteristic symptom is the galling of the roots Tomato plant dug up to reveal galling on roots A close-up of a washed root from the field with large galls.
Extensive galling of tomato roots Healthy tomato plant (left) next to one infested with root knot nematodes (right) Symptoms The characteristic symptom of root knot nematodes is the presence of galls on roots which can be up to 3.3 cm (1 in) in diameter but are usually smaller; galls cause a reduction in plant vigor; if the galls on the roots are extensive then plants may yellow and wilt, particularly in hot weather. Cause Nematode Comments Galls can appear as quickly as a month prior to planting; nematodes prefer sandy soils and damage in areas of field or garden with this type of soil is most likely; disease can be a major problem if soils are infected with Meloidogyne sp.and About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map resistant varieties are not used for production.
Management Plant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil ;check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes; solarizing soil can reduce nematode populations in the soil and levels of inoculum of many other pathogens. Category : Mites Spider mites (Two-spotted spider mite) Tetranychus urticae Spider mite adult Twospotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) adults Close-up view of two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) Spider mites on tomato Spider mite Symptoms Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant.Cause Arachnid Comments Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions; water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack.
Management In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction.

The leaves can reach 30.5â€“35.5 cm (12â€“14 in) in length, while the branching flower stems can reach 30.5â€“91.5 cm (12â€“36 in). The taproot of the plant is is a bulbous tuber, almost perfectly round, which is usually a mixture of purple, white and yellow.Turnip is usually grown as an annual and harvested after one growing season.Turnip may also be referred to as annual turnip and originates from Europe.Turnips and greens White turnips Turnip harvest Turnip Field of turnip Turnips Uses Turnips are eaten as a vegetable after cooking.The shoots and leaves can be eaten fresh in salads or the entire plant can be used as a forage for livestock.Turnip Content Propagation Requirements Turnips are cold hardy vegetables which can be grown early in the spring for a summer harvest or in the summer for harvesting in late fall.They prefer a fertile, well draining soil which has a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.The soil should have a loose texture for optimum root development.
Turnips will grow best in full sun but will tolerate partial shade. The average daily temperature should fall between 10â€“18Â°C (50â€“65Â°F) for adequate growth.Planting Turnips are usually direct seeded and can be sown as soon as the soil is workable in the Spring.For a Fall harvest, sow seeds about 2 months before the first frost in your area.Prepare the soil for planting by loosening it with a fork to a depth of about 30â€“38 cm (12â€“15 in).Remove any large rocks if present.Incorporate 2â€“4 inches of compost into the soil prior to planting.Sow seeds by broadcasting and raking 13 mm (0.5 in) into the soil.Thin seedlings to a final spacing of 7.5â€“10 cm (3â€“4 in).Alternatively, seeds can be sown in rows spaced 30â€“45 cm (12â€“18 in) apart.General care Water turnip plants evenly and keep the soil moist for optimum growth.Mulching the plants will help to conserve moisture in the soil.
Pull any weeds as they appear, the soil can be cultivated down to 2.5â€“5.0 cm (2â€“3 in) when the plants are small but this should be reduced as the plants grow larger to prevent damage to delicate feeder roots. Harvest Turnip greens can be harvested from the plant when the leaves are about 10 cm (10 in) tall.If growing turnips for both greens and roots then only remove 2â€“3 leaves from each plant.Roots are ready to harvest when they reach 2.5â€“7.5 cm (1â€“3 in) in diameter.Small turnips can often be harvested by gently pulling from the soil by hand but larger roots in heavier soil may need gently dug up with a garden fork.Store unwashed roots in a root cellar or basement.

Alternaria lesions on turnip leaf Symptoms Small dark spots on leaves which turn brown to gray; lesions may be round or angular and may possess a purple-black margin; lesions may form concentric rings, become brittle and crack in center; dark brown elongated lesions may develop on stems and petioles Cause Fungus Comments May become a problem during cool, wet periods Management Plant only pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; applications of appropriate fungicides control disease when present Anthracnose Colletotrichum higginisianum Anthracnose symptoms on turnip leaf Symptoms Small circular or irregularly shaped dry spots which are gray to straw in color on leaves; a high number of spots may cause the leaf to die; lesions may coalesce to form large necrotic patches causing leaves to turn yellow and wilt; lesions may split or crack in dry centers; dry sunken spots on roots which enlarge and turn gray or brown Cause Fungus Comments Fungus overwinters on leaf debris and on related weeds; disease emergence is favored by moist, warm conditions Management Control of disease depends on sanitary practices; treat seeds with hot water prior to planting; rotate crops; plant in an area with good soil drainage; remove all cruciferous weeds which may act as a reservoir for the fungus Black root Aphanomyces raphari Symptoms Small black-blue areas on roots which expand and girdle taproot; roots become constricted at site of lesions; black discoloration extends into root Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for prolonged periods Management Control depends on crop rotation with non-brassica species Black rot Xanthomonas campestris Symptoms Seedlings develop wilted yellow to brown leaves and collapse; yellow, V-shaped lesions on mature leaf margins; dark rings can be found in the cross section of the stem Cause Bacterium Comments Disease emergence favors warm, wet conditions Management Primary control methods based on good sanitation; plant disease-free seed; rotate crops every 2 years or less to non- brassica; avoid sprinkler irrigation Cercospora leaf spot (Frogeye leaf spot) Cercospora brassicicola Cercospora lesions on turnip leaf Symptoms Angular or circular green to gray spots with brown borders on leaves; plant defoliation may occur in the case of a severe infestation Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool temperatures and wet weather Management Plant only certified disease-free seed; avoid overhead irrigation; rotate crops to non-brassica species for 2-3 years; apply appropriate fungicide if disease emerges Clubroot Plasmodiophora brassicae Deformed turnip roots caused by club root infection Symptoms Slow growing, stunted plants; yellowish leaves which wilt during day and rejuvenate in part at night; swollen, distorted roots; extensive gall formation Cause Fungus Comments Can be difficult to distinguish from nematode damage; fungus can survive in soil for periods in excess of 10 years; can be spread by movement of contaminated soil and irrigation water to uninfected areas Management Once the pathogen is present in the soil it can survive for many years, elimination of the pathogen is economically unfeasible; rotating crops generally does not provide effective control; plant only certified seed and avoid field grown transplants unless produced in a fumigated bed; applying lime to the soil can reduce fungus sporulation Downy mildew Peronospora parasitica Symptoms Irregular yellow patches on leaves which turn light brown in color; fluffy gray growth on the undersides of the leaves Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool temperatures; disease spreads quickly in wet conditions Management Remove all crop debris after harvest; rotate with non-brassicas; application of appropriate fungicides may be required if symptoms of disease are present Sclerotinia rot (White mold) Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Infections usually begin at the base of the plant and will cause tan water soaked lesions on leaves.
Eventually cottony white mycelia will develop and cover infected tissues. From this mycelia black seed like bodies (sclerotia) will be produced White lesions on turnip stems caused by Sclerotinia rot Symptoms Irregular, necrotic gray lesions on leaves; white-gray leions on stems; reduced pod set; shattering seed pods Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors moderate to cool temperatures and high humidity Management Rotate crop to non-hosts (e.g.
cereals) for at least 3 years; control weeds; avoid dense growth by planting in adequately spaced rows; apply appropriate foliar fungicides White spot Pseudocercosporella capsellae Symptoms Small, necrotic, brown spots on leaf tips or margins that matures to light gray or white with the original dark spot in center; margins of lesions may be darker; lesions may coalesce to form large chlorotic areas and cause defoliation Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool and wet conditions Management No known plant resistance to white leaf spot so control relies on cultural practices such as rotating crops and removing weeds; application of appropriate fungicide may help control the disease Wirestem (Damping-off) Rhizoctonia solani Symptoms Death of seedlings after germination; brown-red or black rot girdling stem; seedling may remain upright but stem is constricted and twisted (wirestem) Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors cool, wet soils Management Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants that have been produced in sterilized soil; apply fungicide to seed to kill off any fungi; shallow plant seeds or delay planting until soil warms Category : Viral Turnip mosaic Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) TuMV symptoms on turnip TuMV infected turnip plants Turnip mosaic virus symptoms on turnip Turnip infected with TuMV TuMV symptoms on turnip TuMV symptoms on turnip Aphid vectors of turnip mosaic feeding on turnip Symptoms Yellow and green mosaic patterns on leaves; necrotic areas on leaves; veinclearing and chlorosis may occur in older leaves; black spots and brown necrotic streaks on stems; stunted plant growth ond reduced yield Cause Virus Comments Transmitted by many species of aphid, including cabbage aphids and peach aphids Management Use of reflective mulches may help to deter aphid feeding; applications of appropriate insecticides may reduce secondary spread of virus Pests Category : Insects Cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicaea Cabbage aphid colony Symptoms Large populations can cause stunted growth or even plant death; insects may be visible on the plant leaves and are small, grey-green in color and soft bodied and are covered with a white waxy coating; prefer to feed deep down in cabbage head and may be obscured by the leaves Cause Insect Comments Cabbage aphids feed only on cruciferous plants but may survive on related weed species Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Flea beetles Phyllotreta spp.
Crucifer flea beetle Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Root maggots Delia spp.
Root maggots in soil Symptoms Scars and feeding tunnels on surface of turnip; root damage may be extensive; larvae are white or white-yellow in color, reach approx. 1 cm (0.3 in) in length and taper towards the head; adult insect is a small fly which resembles a housefly Cause Insect Comments Root maggots will attack all varieties of crucuferous plants; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil Management If root maggots were problematic, avoid planting root crops in same area the following year; if crops are too badly damaged to harvest remove and destroy all crop debris; use of floating row covers can dramatically reduce damage to crops by preventing female flies from laying eggs - note, row covers only effective where root maggots are not already present; there are currently no pesticides registered for use on root maggots in the home garden in the USA Wireworms Aeolus spp.Anchastus spp.Melanotus spp.

The vanilla plant has a long succulent stem and grows by wrapping around trees. The vine has alternate, fleshy oblong or lanceolate leaves which are rounded at the base.The plant produces flowers on short racemes, each possessing 6â€“15 flowers, and fruits which take the form of narrow, cylindrical pods (or beans), each possessing many small black seeds.The vanilla plant can reach a height of 10â€“15 m (33â€“49 ft) in height and has an economic lifespan of approximately 10 years.The plant is native to Central America.Vanilla plant Variegated vanilla foliage Vanilla pods Vanilla pods Vanilla flower Vanilla plant with seed pods Uses Vanilla bean extract is used a flavoring in confectionery and baking.Essential oils extracted from the plant are also used in the perfume industry.Vanilla Content Propagation Basic requirements Vanilla is a tropical plant and will grow best in warm, humid climates at temperatures between 21 and 32Â°C (33.8â€“89.6Â°F).
Vanilla requires a soil rich in calcium and potassium and will grow best in a soil which is light and well-draining, with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Vanilla is a climbing plant and should always be provided with a support to grow on.It is usually planted alongside a companion tree, known as a tutor tree which has the added benefit of providing it with shade.Vanilla grows naturally in forests, often in clearings and alongside rivers and lakes where the forest canopy is thinner.Propagation Vanilla is usually propagated vegetatively from stem cuttings from a mother plant which has not been allowed to flower.Cuttings are best taken during the dry season when growth of the vines is slower.A cutting of 1.5 m (5 ft) should be taken and planted at the base of the support tree after removing the lower leaves.Cuttings should be planted at least 2 m (6.6 ft) apart.If a support tree is being used, it is preferable to use a type with a high number of lower branches.
Vanilla may also be grown on a trellis or support post. General care and maintenance Vanilla should be managed to keep the vines at a manageable height as left unchecked they will continue to grow to the crowns of the supporting trees.When the plants reach a height of 1.6â€“1.8 m they should be bent back over the nearest suitable branch and the end of the shoot planted back into the ground and covered with soil.Planting the end of the shoot encourages the growth of roots and the continual production of newly rooted shoots helps to maintain a healthy plantation.Shoots may also be cut at the desired height and planted next to the same tutor tree once the wound has dried to create a new rooted plant.Vanilla should be mulched with organic mulch such as grass clippings to help suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture.Vanilla will benefit from the addition of fertilizer but applications are unnecessary and are rarely made in commercial production.
Vanilla is naturally pollinated by small mexican bees and, although pollination is possible if the bees are present, plants are usually hand pollinated to ensure production. Harvesting Vanilla is ready for harvest between 6 and 9 months after flowering when the pods are still dark green and the tip is beginning to turn yellow.References Augstburger, F., Berger, J., Censkowsky, U., Heid, P., Milz, J.& Streit, C.(2000) Vanilla.Natureland e.V.Available at: http://www.naturland.de/fileadmin/MDB/documents/Publication/English/vanilla.PDF.[Accessed 22 April 15].Free to access .CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2008).Vanilla planifolia (vanilla) datasheet.Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/56074.[Accessed 22 April 15].Paid subscription required .Common Pests and Diseases Diseases Category : Fungal Anthracnose Colletotrichum spp.
Symptoms Small, sunken, dark brown spots on leaves, fruits, stems and/or flowers; infected fruits dropping from plants before they reach maturity; damage to fruit is more pronounced during warm and humid periods of the growing season; symptoms generally develop first on apical parts of plant and spread to leaves and stems Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence is favored by excessive shading of plants and overcrowding Management Provide plants with adequate fertilization; application of an appropriate fungicicde, e.g. Bordeaux mixture, can help to protect the plant from the disease Black rot Phytophthora spp.
Symptoms Water-soaked green to black rot of stems, leaves and/or pods; thin white mycelium may be visible in infected tissues; disease usually begins at the apical part of the plant and spreads to leaves, stems and all other parts of the plant Cause Oomycete Comments Disease emergence favored by prolonged wet weather, poorly draining soil, excessive shading of plants, overcrowded plants and lack of weed control in the plantation Management Plant vanilla using recommended spacing; control weeds around plants; remove infected parts of plants and destroy by burning; application of appropriate fungicide can help to protect the plants from disease Rust Uromyces joffrini Symptoms Yellow to orange pustules on undersides of leaves which enlarge and coalesce causing the entire leaf to dry out; plant development slows and if disease is left untreated then plant becomes unproductive, defoliates and dies Cause Fungus Comments Rust is most common in traditional vanilla plantations where there is overcrowding, excessive shading of plants and excessive moisture Management Removal of some leaves from the plants allows better penetration of sunlight; disease can be controlled through the application of appropriate fungicides Category : Oomycete Root and stem rot Fusarium batatatis Symptoms Fungus causes brown lesions on roots which turn brown and dry out; plants begin to rot at the apical tip and stop growing; plant begins to produce new roots from apical tissue; if there is not enough moisture, stems dry out and crack longitudinally; cracks will eventually cover the whole stem and the plant will die Cause Fungus Comments Emergence of the disease is favored by excessive soil moisture, too much shading of plants, inadequate fertilization, over-crowding and drought stress Management Plant vanilla in well-draining soils and avoid overcrowding the plants; prune out infected plant parts; plant vanilla varieties that are tolerant of resistant to the disease About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Walnut, Juglans regia , is a deciduous tree in the Family Juglandaceae grown for its edible seeds.
Walnut trees are large and vigorous with a wide-spreading canopy. The trunk of the tree can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter and mature trees possess smooth, silver-gray bark.Walnut leaves are composed of an odd number of smaller, oval shaped leaflets which are bright green in color.The tree produces male flowers on catkins and female flowers on terminal clusters where the fruit develops.The fruit of the walnut tree is a fleshy green drupe in which the nut is encased.The kernel of the nut is protected by a corrugated woody shell.Walnut trees can reach 25â€“35 m (82â€“115 ft) in height and can live for periods in excess of 200 years.Walnut may also be referred to as Persian walnut, English walnut, common walnut or European walnut and originates from central Asia.Nut Mature tree Female flowers Walnut catkins Walnut foliage Walnut fruit on the branch Uses Walnut kernels can be eaten fresh or processed for use in baked goods and confectionery.
The timber of the tree is a Walnut Content highly valued as a wood for furniture making in Europe. Kernels may also be used as an animal feed or used to extract oil which was once a popular thinner for oil based paints.Propagation Basic requirements Walnut can be grown successfully in a wide variety of climates but blossoms can be damaged by frost or high humidity.Must walnut varieties have a winter chilling requirement of 800â€“1000 hours below 7Â°C (45Â°F) to break dormancy and require a growing season of at least 200 frost-free days.Walnut trees should be planted in areas where there is good air circulation and drainage and will grow optimally when planted in a deep, fertile, well-draining loam soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5.Walnut roots systems can be extensive and It is not unusual for walnut roots to grow to depths of 4.5 m (15 ft).Water-logged soils will limit root growth and should be avoided.
Walnuts will usually begin to produce in the fourth or fifth year following planting. Propagation Walnut trees are usually propagated vegetatively by budding or grafting, while saplings for rootstock are grown from seed.The planting site should be prepared by levelling the ground and eliminating weeds.Trees are planted by digging a hole that is twice as wide as the existing root ball.Aged manure or compost may be added to the soil at time of planting by incorporating it into the backfill soil.Trees should be spaced 10â€“15 m (33â€“50 ft) apart.In commercial plantations, trees may be spaced closer together.Grafted trees will begin to bear fruit in 5 years, while non-grafted plants may take 7-8 years.Newly planted young trees require staking as the new wood is soft and the tree can be damaged by winds.General care and maintenance Walnut trees should be trained to a central leader or modified leader system.Trees should be pruned in the Fall to prevent sap bleeding.
Once the desired shape has been achieved, annual pruning should focus on thinning the tops of the trees to allow better air and light penetration to the canopy. In commercial orchards, lower limbs may be removed to facilitate the movement of machinery through the orchard.Newly planted walnut trees should be provided with supplemental irrigation for the first two years following planting.Trees should be watered deeply and the soil allowed to dry out between waterings.Irrigation is also required in the period after bloom in order to maximize nut production.In addition to an initial application of manure at planting, trees should be provided with 100â€“400 g of nitrogen per tree until the fifth year.In the sixth year, trees may be provided with up to 100 kg of nitrogen per hectare.Harvesting Walnuts in the home garden can simply be collected when they drop from the tree.In commercial orchards, walnuts are commonly harvested with the used of a mechanical shaker.
Once the nuts are collected, they must be immediately hulled (the process of removing the nut from the green flesh) and dried.

Watermelon vines are thin, grooved and covered in tiny hairs. Vines are branching and possess deeply lobed pinnate leaves.The plant produces solitary yellow flowers and and a large spherical to oblong fruit.The fruit is a 'pepo' - a fleshy fruit protected by a thick leathery rind.The fruit is smooth, light to dark green in color and can be striped, marbled or solid green.The flesh of the fruit is usually red in color but some cultivars produce green, orange or white flesh and contains numerous seeds which are usually black or dark brown in color.Watermelon vines can reach a length of 3 m (10 ft) and as an annual, survives only one growing season.Watermelon originates from Africa.Watermelon cut open to show flesh and seeds Young watermelon fruit developing on the vine Watermelon on vine Watermelon on vine Watermelon blossom Watermelon blossom Uses Watermelon is usually consumed as a fresh fruit.
In Africa it is sometimes cooked before eating and may also be used as Watermelon Content an animal feed. Propagation Requirements Watermelon is a warm-season crop, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 28Â°C (65â€“82Â°F).Watermelon will yield best if grown in a light, well- draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.Watermelon should be planted in full sun and heavy feeders.They need to be provided with even soil moisture and fertilized regularly.Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space.Sowing seeds Watermelon can be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season but in more Northern climates it should be sown indoors and transplanted.If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 18.4Â°C (65Â°F).
Allow 90â€“120 cm (~3â€“4 ft) between seeds in a row and 150â€“180 cm (~5â€“6 ft) between rows. If transplanting, seeds should be sown approximately 3â€“4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted after the plants develop their first set of true leaves.Sow seeds in 3â€“4 in pots using a sterile seed starting mix and planting to a depth of 1â€“2 cm (~0.5 in).Thin seedlings once they are established.Seeds sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering as seeds are prone to rotting.Seeds should germinate in 3â€“10 days depending on the soil temperature.Transplanting Watermelon seedlings should be transplanted when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 18.4Â°C (65Â°F).Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting.
Beginning approximately 7â€“10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth.When transplanting seedlings, allow 90â€“120 cm (~3â€“4 ft) between plants and 150â€“180 cm (~5â€“6 ft) between rows.Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist.General care Watermelon vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow.Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence to save space.Watermelon plants Watermelons have a very deep root system which allows them to access soil moisture efficiently.However, if conditions are very dry for prolonged periods then additional water should be provided..
Plastic mulches are highly recommended in areas where conditions are not ideal for growth as they conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene has the advantage of warming the soil. Floating row covers can be beneficial while the plants establish to protect against insect pests.Harvesting Watermelons are ready to be harvested when the the tendrils closest to the fruit are beginning to dry out and turn brown.The underside of the melon should be beginning to turn yellow Watermelon seedling Germinating watermelon References CABI Crop Protection Compendium.(2010).Citrullus lanatus (watermelon).Available at: http://www.cabi.org/cpc/datasheet/13678.[Accessed 21 April 15].Paid subscription required .Roberts, W., Motes, J., Damicone, J., Duthie, J.& Edelson, J.Watermelon production.Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service.Available at: http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-1110/F-6236web.pdf.[Accessed 21 April 15].Free to access .Saha, S.(2014).Watermelon.

brown or white lesions on crown and stems; soft, circular brown lesions on fruit; lesions on stems and fruit may be oozing an amber colored sticky substance Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can be spread b infected seed, air currents or water splash; survives on plant debris in soil; disease emergence is favored by warm, wet conditions Management Use disease free seed; treat seeds prior to planting; rotate crops every 2-3 years to a non-cucurbit to reduce disease build up in soil; reduce crop residue in soil by plowing plant debris into soil after harvest; application of preventative fungicides are usually required to control the disease successfully Powdery mildew Podosphaera xanthii Podosphaera fuliginea Symptoms of powdery mildew on watermelon leaves Symptoms of powdery mildew on watermelon leaves Symptoms of powdery mildew on watermelon leaves Symptoms Reddish or bronze appearance of older leaves; obvious patches of white powdery growth on leaves Cause Fungi Comments Disease emergence favored by dry weather and high relative humidity Management Plant in sites with good air circulation and sun exposure; do not overcrowd plants; sanitize equipment regularly Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae Symptoms Symptoms generally appear after fruit set; chlorotic leaves which develop necrotic areas; leaves collapsing; symptoms only on one side of vine; discoloration of vascular tissue in roots Cause Fungus Comments Fungus can survive in soil for many years; disease emergence favored by cool or mild weather in Spring Management Do not plant in areas where other susceptible crops have been grown previously; delay planting until temperatures are warmer Category : Bacterial Angular leaf spot Pseudomonas syringae Symptoms Small water-soaked lesions on leaves which expand between leaf veins and become angular in shape; in humid conditions, lesions exude a milky substance which dries to form a white crust on or beside lesions; as the disease progresses, lesions turn tan and may have yellow/green edges; the centers of the lesions dry and may drop out leaving a hole in the leaf Cause Bacterium Comments Spread through infected seed, splashing rain, insects and movement of people between plants; bacterium overwinters in crop debris and can survive for 2.5 years Management Use disease-free seed; do not grow plants in field where cucurbits have been grown in the previous 2 years; protective copper spray may help reduce incidence of disease in warm, humid climates; plant resistant varieties Bacterial fruit blotch Acidovorax avenae Symptoms of bacterial fruit blotch on watermelon fruit Symptoms of bacterial fruit blotch on watermelon foliage Symptoms of bacterial fruit blotch on watermelon fruit Symptoms of bacterial fruit blotch on watermelon foliage Symptoms of bacterial fruit blotch on watermelon fruit Symptoms Small water-soaked lesions on top or sides of fruit which enlarge over surface; lesions on fruit may turn reddish or brown and crack Cause Bacterium Comments Spread through infected seed or water splash; disease emergence favors wet conditions Management Use pathogen-free seed and transplants; rotate crops; avoid the use of overhead irrigation Category : Other Aster yellows Aster yellows phytoplasma Symptoms Foliage turning yellow; secondary shoots begin growing prolifically; stems take on a rigid, upright growth habit; leaves are often small in size and distorted, may appear thickened; flowers are often disfigured and possess conspicuous leafy bracts; fruits are small and pale in color Cause Phytoplasma Comments Disease is transmitted by leafhoppers and can cause huge losses in cucurbit crops Management Remove any infected plants from the field to reduce spread; control weeds in and around the field that may act as a reservoir for the phytoplasma; protect plants from leaf hopper vectors with row covers Blossom-end rot Symptoms Symptoms first appear on immature fruits as small light brown spots close to the blossom end of the fruit; as fruit grow, the spots enlarge, resulting in dark leathery lesions sunken into the fruit Cause Nutritional disorder Comments Watermelon varieties that produce long fruit are more susceptible to blossom-end rot Management Blossom-end rot is caused by a lack of calcium in the developing fruit and it occurs when the uptake of nutrients to the plant is disrupted; factors which disrupt nutrient uptake include drought, root damage or high soil salinity; application of excess nitrogen fertilizer may also contribute to the development of blossom-end rot as it promotes vigorous growth of vegetative tissues and depletion of calcium in the soil; watering plants evenly and regularly reduces the incidence of blossom-end rot Category : Viral Cucumber green mottle mosaic Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) Symptoms Early symptoms on young plants include vein-clearing and the development of crumpled leaves; older plants develop bleached and/or chlorotic leaves.
As the infection progresses, leaves develop mottling and become blistered and distorted. Leaf symptoms are very difficult to distinguish from other mosaic viruses of Cucurbits/ Severity of symptoms varies depending on the strain of the virus.Cause Virus Comments All Cucurbit species are susceptible to the virus, some cucumber varieties have been developed which have some resistance to the disease and are available in Canada and Europe.Management As the virus is spread primarily by infected seed, only disease-free seed from a reputable supplier should be planted.Seedlings and plants infected with the virus should be removed and destroyed to prevent spread.All seedlings/plants within a 3-5 ft radius of the infected plant should also be destroyed.
The virus can be spread mechanically via tools and on hands, good sanitation should be practiced at all times to prevent virus transmission - disinfect all tools and equipment between uses by dipping in a solution of bleach or using a commercially available disinfectant such as Virkon. Cucumber mosaic Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Symptoms Plants may e severely stunted; foliage is covered in distinctive yellow mosaic; leaves of plant curl downwards and leaf size is smaller than normal; flowers on infected plants may be deformed with green petals; fruits become distorted and are small in size; fruit is often discolored Cause Viruses Comments Transmitted by aphids; virus has an extensive host range; can be mechanically transmitted via tools etc.
Management Control of the virus is largely dependant on the control of the aphid vectors; reflective mulches can deter aphid feeding; aphid outbreaks can be treated with mineral oils or insecticidal soap applications; some resistant varieties are available Watermelon mosaic Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) Symptoms Symptoms vary widely depending on species, cultivar, virus strain and environmental conditions; symptoms on leaves may include green mosaic patternation, green vein-banding, chlorotic rings and disfigured leaves Cause Virus Comments Virus is found in almost all Cucurbit growing regions in the world; virus is spread by over 20 aphid species Management Treatments that control populations of aphid vectors can also reduce the incidence of the virus; spraying plants with mineral oils or insecticidal soaps can help to reduce aphid numbers Zucchini yellow mosaic Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) Symptoms Infected plants are severely stunted and leaves can exhibit a variety of symptoms including yellow mosaic patternation, severe deformation, blistering, reduced size and necrosis; fruits are deformed Cause Virus Comments DIsease can cause devastating epidemics when present Management Use of resistant varieties, where available, is usually the most effective method of controlling the virus; control of aphid populations on the plants can be achieved through the use of mineral oils and insecticidal soaps but is rarely effective at controlling the virus Pests Category : Insects Aphids (Peach aphid, Melon aphid) Myzus persicae Aphid gossypii Peach aphid colony Symptoms Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants Cause Insects Comments Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed Management If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company Slide Set, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Bugwood.org Symptoms Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color Cause Insect Comments Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range Management Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand- picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully Cutworms Agrotis spp.
Peridroma saucia Nephelodes minians and others Cutworm severing plant stem Symptoms Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5â€“5.0 cm (1â€“2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed Cause Insects Comments Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato Management Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically Flea beetles Epitrix spp.
Symptoms Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic â€œshotholeâ€​ appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5â€“3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance Cause Insects Comments Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year Management In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.) Frankliniella occidentalis Thrips tabaci Symptoms If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color Cause Insect Comments Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life Management Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back This page is available in French.
Description Wheat, is the name given to several plants in the genus Triticum including Triticum aestivum , Triticum compactum , Triticum spelta and Triticum durum , which are annual or biennial grasses grown primarily for their grain. Wheat species possess an erect smooth stem with linear leaves that grow in two rows on either side of the stem with larger 'flag' leaves at the top of the stem.The stem terminates in a spike that is made up on individual spikelets, each possessing 3â€“9 florets.The wheat fruit develops within the spikelets, maturing to a seed (kernel).Wheat can reach 1.2 m (4 ft) in height and like other cereals, has been developed into different varieties that are adapted to planting at different times of the year.Spring wheat is planted for a late summer harvest, whereas Winter wheat is planted for harvesting in early to mid summer.Overwintering varieties are more commonly grown in regions with mild winters.
Wheat may be referred to by variety and these include durum or macaroni wheat ( Triticum durum ), club wheat ( Triticum compactum ), spelt wheat ( Triticum spelta ) and bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). Wheat originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East.Wheat harvest Wheat spikes Ripe wheat close-up Close-up of ripe wheat spike Immature wheat Combine harvesting wheat Wheat Content Wheat seedlings Wheat seed head (spike) Wheat field Uses Wheat is one of the most important food plants in the world.It is used primarily to produce flour for bread.It is used widely in the production of many other baked goods.Wheat grain is also used in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages and alcohol.Wheat straw is used as an animal feed and in the manufacture of carpets, baskets, packing, bedding, and paper.Propagation Wheat varieties One of the first things to consider before planting is which type of wheat you want to grow.
There are several different varieties to choose from depending on the time of year and how you want to utilize your harvest. Wheat is broadly categorized into Winter wheat and Spring wheat.Winter wheat is high yielding and is planted in the Fall and harvested in the Spring or Summer of the following year (depending on location).Spring wheat is not as high yielding but tolerated drier conditions.It is planted in the Spring and harvested in the Fall.Both Spring and Winter wheat is then further categorized as soft wheat, hard wheat, spelt or durum.General requirements Wheat can be grown in a wide variety of climates but grows best in cool regions where the temperature is between 10 and 24Â°C (50â€“75Â°F).Wheat will not grow at temperatures above 35Â°C (95Â°F).Wheat will grow optimally in a deep, fertile, well draining and well aerated soil at a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.Planting Winter wheat varieties should be planted in the Fall approximately 6 to 8 weeks before the first frost date.
Spring wheat varieties should be planted as soon as the soil can be worked in the Spring. Commercially grown wheat is usually mechanically drilled using a machine that creates a furrow and drops the seed in before covering it back up.Wheat seeds can be sown by hand broadcasting in smaller areas, or using a hand-cranked seeder.Seeds are usually sown to at depths ranging from 2 to 12 cm (0.8â€“4.7 in) depending on soil conditions (seed must be sown deeper in drier soil).Once the seeds have been scattered, the soil should be raked lightly to set the seeds at the desired depth.Harvesting Wheat is ready to harvest when the stalks and heads have turned from green to yellow and the seed heads are drooping towards the ground.Check the seeds for ripeness before harvest.The should be firm and crunchy and not doughy in texture.Commercially produced wheat is usually harvested using a combine.Smaller plots can be harvested by hand using a scythe or sickle.
Small plots can be harvested by snipping off the heads with a pair of scissors. Commercially produced wheat is usually harvested by combine Winter wheat seedlings References Bockus, W., W., Bowden, R.L., Hunger, R.M., Morrill, W.L., Murray, T.D.& Smiley, R.W.(eds.)

Wheat spike showing symptoms of common bunt, also known as stinking smut. Symptoms Slender heads which take longer to turn color than healthy heads; glumes spread apart to reveal spori or "bunt balls" (balls containing fungal spores) which are a similar size to normal kernel but are gray-brown in color; bunt balls break open on harvest and give off a fishy odor Cause Fungus Comments Disease is most commonly introduced through infected seed although spores are spread by wind Management Disease can be controlled by planting resistant wheat varieties, planting disease-free seed and using a seed treatment prior to planting; disease may also be avoided by planting wheat early in the Fall and by shallow seeding Ergot disease Claviceps purpurea Ergot on wheat spike Wheat spikes infected with ergot Symptoms Main symptoms of ergot is the grains in the head are replaced by dark purple to black sclerotia.This ergot bodies were made up of vegetative strands of fungus.
The sclerotic interior is white or tennis white in color. The size of grain kernel and ergot are similar in size.The initial symptom before sclerotia bodies is honey dew symptom occur during flowering stage.The fungus produce yellowish, sugary excretions and can see as droplets on flower parts.Cause Fungal Comments Ergot is toxic to animals including birds.Management Follow crop rotation with non host crops for one year.Deep summer ploughing kills sclerotia bodies present in soil.Keep the field free from grasses and other weeds.Use disease free seeds.Eyespot Oculimacula spp.Wheat stems showing lesions caused by eyespot (Oculimacula yallundae).
Eyespot lesion on wheat stem Eyespot lesions girdling wheat stems Symptoms Elliptical lesions that first appear on leaf sheath and gradually spread to stem; lesions are yellow-brown to tan in color and occur length-ways down the stem; lesions can occur individually or groups of lesions can coalesce to form large areas of discoloration; lesions may eventually girdle the stem; a gray, thread-like fungal growth may occur on the stem beneath the lesion; mature stems may have a charred appearance; infected tillers mature early and develop white heads and poorly filled seed; tillers may fall if stems are severely infected Cause Fungus Comments Primary route of infection is by splashing water; emergence of disease favored by high soil moisture content and a dense crop canopy Management Rotation of crop away from cereals for a period of 2-3 years will reduce levels of inoculum in the field; fungicides are commonly applied close to stem elongation to control the disease; plant resistant wheat varieties if available in your area Fusarium head blight (Scab) Fusarium spp.
Fusarium head blight symptoms on wheat Fusarium head blight symptoms on wheat Partially bleached heads in field of wheat Symptoms One or more spikelets on newly emerged head bleached; pink or orange fungal masses may be visible at the base of infected spikelet; infected spikelets do not produce seed or produce shriveled and/or discolored seed; severe infections can cause the kernels to have a chalky appearance and are frequently lost during harvest Cause Fungus Comments Fungus survives between seasons on host plant debris - other host include corn and barley; fungus can survive on host debris for several years; warm, moist conditions promote the spread of the disease when present Management Control of the disease can be difficult; durum wheat appears to be more susceptible to the disease than common wheat; crop rotation to a non-host is recommended for at least one year; applications of appropriate fungicides if available can help to control the disease in conjunction with the other measures detailed here Phythium root rot Phythium sp.
Wheat seedlings showing "damping off", which can be caused pre- or post-emergence by early infection with fungi causing common root rot, foot rot, and crown rot, which may be numerous Helminthosporium, Fusarium, or Pythiurn species. Symptoms The infected plants become chlorotic and/ stunted.Often the symptom is confused with nitrogen deficiency.And the plants may produce shriveled grain.Even a mild infection reduce tillers, plant population and maturity.Since symptom appear through out the field make if difficult to diagnose the disease.Cause Fungal Comments Fungus live for years in soil and on old root debris.Management Use good quality seeds.Provide supplemental phosphorous.Sowing when soil temperature is about 50 F increase germination and establishment.Seed treatment with suitable fungicides.
Powdery mildew Erysiphe graminis Wheat leaf showing powdery mildew Powdery mildew symptoms on wheat Powdery mildew on wheat Powdery mildew colonies on wheat leaf Wheat leaf showing fungal growths due to powdery mildew Symptoms Patches of cottony, white-gray growth on upper surface of leaves which turn gray-brown; chlorotic patches develop on leaves opposite fungal growth; fungal fruiting bodies usually become visible as black dots on the mildew Cause Fungus Comments Disease emergence favors heavy nitrogen fertilization; high humidity and cool temperatures Management Planting resistant wheat varieties is one of the best ways to protect plants from powdery mildew; other control strategies include: application of appropriate foliar fungicides, if available; removal of crop debris from field after harvest to reduce the level of overwintering fungus; removal of volunteer wheat plants which can act as a reservoir for the disease Rusts Stem rust ( Puccinia graminis ) Leaf rust ( P.

Limonius spp Wireworm larvae Symptoms Death of seedlings; reduced stand; girdled stems and white heads; wireworm larvae can be found in soil when dug round the stem; larvae are yellow-brown, thin worms with shiny skin Cause Insect Comments Larval stage can last between 1 and 5 years depending on species Management Chemical control impossible in a standing crop, must be applied at preplanting or as a seed treatment; if wireworms are known to be present in soil fallow field during summer and till frequently to reduce numbers; rotate to non-host crop where possible; avoid planting susceptible crops after a wireworm infestation on cereals without either fallowing of applying appropriate pesticide Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Diseases & Pests Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Register or Sign in Go Back Description Yam is the name given to several plant species in the genus Dioscorea including Dioscorea alata (white yam), Dioscorea bulbifera (potato yam), Dioscorea cayenensis (yellow yam), Dioscorea esculenta (Asiatic yam) and Dioscorea batatas (Chinese yam) that are grown for their edible tubers.
These species are not to be confused with the sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas , which is often referred to as a yam in the US. Yam plants are herbaceous annual or perennials with climbing or trailing vines.The vines can be smooth or prickly, reaching 10 m (32.8 ft) or more in length depending on the variety.The leaves of the plant are simple and usually oval to heart-shaped with petioles which are the same length, or slightly longer, than the leaf blade itself.Some varieties possess spikes at the bases of the leaves.The plant can produce one singular tuber or several tubers which extend from stolons from a central corm (up to 20) depending on the species.The tubers can be cylindrical, curved or lobed, with brown, grey, black or pink skin and white, orange or purplish flesh.
Most yams are annual plants, harvested after one season, but some are perennial with tubers increasing in size each year with the vines dying back at the end of the growing season and regrowing on the return of favorable conditions. The origin of yams is uncertain and genetic information suggests that there may be more than one point of origin.Dioscorea bulbifera Uses Yams Content Yams are used differently in different parts of the world.They are consumed after cooking by frying, boiling or roasting.The green parts of some plants can be cooked and consumed as a vegetable.Yams may also be used to produce flour or starch.Yam tubers at market Propagation Basic requirements Yams are mainly grown in tropical and subtropical climates and they do not grow well at temperatures below 22Â°C (71.6Â°F) and are killed by frost..The optimum temperature for the growth of yams is between 25 and 30Â°C (77â€“86Â°F).
They grow optimally in well-draining fertile soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 in full sun or part shade. Very wet soils should be avoided as this promotes tuber rot.Propagation Yams are propagated vegetatively from small tubers.Land should be prepared for planting by plowing and harrowing.Tubers should be planted in trenches to a depth of 15 cm (6 in) allowing at least 30 cm (12 in) between individual plants and 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows.The soil is often mounded around plants or ridged to aid drainage.It is common practice to stake plants with a 2â€“4 m (6.6â€“13.2 ft) support to allow them to climb and ensure that all parts of the plant receive adequate sunlight.General care and maintenance Yams require 100 cm of water distributed evenly throughout the growing season.Yam plants should be mulched after planting to prevent plants from drying out.Failure to mulch the plants will result in drastic decreases in yield.
Harvesting Yams can be harvested at any time after the leaves have started to yellow. The soil should be carefully dug around the tuber and the the tuber cut from the vine.Harvesting is best carried out on sunny, dry days to prevent tuber rot.References Farmer's bookshelf.Yam.A University of Hawaii Department of Tropical Plant & Soil Sciences University of Hawaii at Manoa.Available at: http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/fb/yam/yam.htm.[Accessed 21 April 15].

If the disease is severe the leaves become long, thin and strap shape (called shoe-string symptom) and whole plant become stunted. Plant may produce few small tubers with less starch content.Some plants may recover from the virus infection soon after first symptom but virus may survive in plant and reduce the vigour.Cause Virus Comments The virus is transmitted by aphids and tubers/setts.It may cause up to 40% loss in yield.Yam mosaic virus is always associated with yam mild mosaic virus, yam badnaviruses and cucumber mosaic virus in Africa making this disease more complex.Disease is reported in West Africa , South America and Caribbean.Management Use healthy and disease free tubers or setts for planting.Select healthy and large tubers for planting instead of small tubers.Keep fields free from weeds.Collect crop debris and destroy them.
Pests Category : Nematodes Dry rot disease (caused by yam nematode) Scutellonema bradys Yam tubers infested by nematode and white scale insect Yam tuber infested by dry rot nematode Symptoms The infected tubers show dry rot of 1 to 2 cm. Initially this dry rot is of cream and light yellow lesions appear just below the outer skin without any external symptom.With progress in disease lesion spreads deeper (maximum up to 2 cm).At later stage the rot become light and dark brown to black in color and tubers may show external cracks.Entry of fungus through this wounds causes further decay of tubers in storage.There is no above ground symptom with yam nematode infestation.Cause Nematode Comments Some time the infected tubers may not show external cracking which make it difficult to diagnose.In that case scrap out the external layer of tuber to check the disease incidence.Management Use disease free tubers/setts for planting.
Treating tubers with hot water for 40 min at 50-55 C before sowing and after harvest to reduce disease both in field and storage. In Africa smearing tubers with wood ash or cow dung shows reduced nematode infection in field.Follow crop rotation with non host or antagonist crops like ground nut, sorghum, maize, chill pepper etc.Root Knot Nematode Meloidogyne incognita(Kofoid & White) Galled tubers with crazy roots Symptoms The infected plants are stunted with poor growth.The leaves turn yellow in color.Tubers and feeder roots are galled.Tubers are deformed and develop abnormal rootlets.Reduction in edible portion of tubers.Cause Nematode Comments It reduces market value and quality of tubers (up to 32 - 59 % in Nigeria).The actual yield loss is estimated up to 27 to 55 %.Management Deep summer ploughing to expose and kill nematode.Follow crop rotation with non host crops like groundnut and maize.Category : Insects Mealybugs Rastrococcus spp.
Symptoms Flattened oval to round disc-like insect covered in waxy substance on tree branches; insects attract ants which may also be present; insect colony may also be associated with growth of sooty mold due to fungal colonization of sugary honeydew excreted by the insect Cause Insect Comments Insects have a wide host range; often tended by ants which farm them for their sugary honeydew secretions Management Prune out heavily infested branches; mealybugs can potentially be controlled by natural enemies; chemical pesticides may decrease populations of natural enemies leading to mealybug outbreaks; horticultural oils or soapy solutions can be used to treat heavy infestations White Scale insects Aspidiella hartii About Projects Team Blog Donate Contact us For Farmers Crops Pests & Diseases Topics Q & A Video Library For Researchers Stress Map Locust Map Support out project by donating or participating Donate Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Terms Yam tuber infested by white scale insect (2) White scale insects infested yam tubers Yam tuber infested by white scale insect Symptoms The leaves and tubers are covered with small white scales from field to storage.
